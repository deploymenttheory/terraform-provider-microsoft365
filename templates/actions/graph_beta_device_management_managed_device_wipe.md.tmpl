### Wipe vs Retire

| Action | Data Removed | Use Case |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Wipe** | All data (factory reset) | Company devices, security incidents, recycling |
| **Retire** | Company data only | BYOD devices, selective removal |

### Wipe Options

#### `keep_enrollment_data`
- Preserves enrollment data during wipe
- Allows device to automatically re-enroll
- Useful for device refresh scenarios
- Supported: Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Android

#### `keep_user_data`
- Performs selective wipe
- Only company data removed
- Personal data preserved
- Similar to retire action
- Supported: iOS, iPadOS, Windows

#### `macos_unlock_code`
- 6-digit PIN for macOS Activation Lock bypass
- Required for macOS with Activation Lock
- Retrieved from Intune portal
- Must be provided before wipe
- macOS only

#### `obliteration_behavior`
- Controls fallback when Erase All Content and Settings (EACS) fails
- Options: `default`, `doNotObliterate`, `obliterateWithWarning`, `always`
- macOS 12+ with Apple M1/T2 chip only
- Affects data erasure completeness

#### `persist_esim_data_plan`
- Preserves eSIM cellular data plan
- Prevents need to reconfigure cellular
- iOS/iPadOS with eSIM support

#### `use_protected_wipe`
- Attempts to preserve UEFI licenses
- Windows-specific option
- May help with Windows reactivation

### What Gets Removed

- **All user data** (unless `keep_user_data` specified)
- **All apps** (system and installed)
- **All settings and configurations**
- **Management enrollment** (unless `keep_enrollment_data`)
- **Accounts and profiles**
- **Device returns to factory state**

### Common Use Cases

- Device recycling or disposal
- Device repurposing for new user
- Security incident response (compromised device)
- Stolen device data protection
- Device return to vendor
- Complete device reset needed
- Departing employee (company device)
- Device compliance violation

### Security Considerations

- **Irreversible**: Data cannot be recovered
- **Activation Lock**: Handle for iOS/macOS devices
- **BitLocker**: Recovery keys may be needed
- **Backup**: Ensure important data backed up
- **Verification**: Confirm correct device before wiping
- **Documentation**: Log reason for wipe
- **Compliance**: Follow data retention policies

### User Impact - CRITICAL

- **ALL data lost permanently**
- **Cannot be undone**
- **Device unusable until reconfigured**
- **Personal data lost** (unless `keep_user_data`)
- **Photos, documents, apps removed**
- **Accounts must be reconfigured**
- **May take several minutes to complete**

### Best Practices

- **Verify device ID** before wiping
- **Confirm with user** for BYOD
- **Back up critical data** first
- **Document business justification**
- **Use retire for BYOD** instead
- **Test selective wipe** options first
- **Consider Activation Lock** for Apple devices
- **Plan for device reprovisioning**
- **Communicate with users**
- **Follow change management** procedures

### Wipe Process

1. Wipe command issued via this action
2. Command queued in Intune
3. Device receives command (when online)
4. Device begins factory reset
5. All data erased
6. Device returns to setup screen
7. Device can be reconfigured
8. Re-enrollment (if `keep_enrollment_data`)
