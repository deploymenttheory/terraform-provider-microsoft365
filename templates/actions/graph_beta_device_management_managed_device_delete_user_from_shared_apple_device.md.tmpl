### Delete User vs Logout User

| Action | Effect | Data Impact | User Can Return | Use Case |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Delete User** | Permanent removal | All cached data deleted | No (must be re-added) | User left organization, storage cleanup |
| **Logout User** | Temporary logout | Data preserved | Yes (immediately) | Session management, device rotation |

### What Gets Deleted

**User Account**
- User removed from device roster
- Cannot log into this specific device
- Must be re-added to regain access

**Cached Data**
- Documents and files
- Photos and media
- App data and settings
- Downloaded content
- Offline cached data
- User preferences

**Storage Impact**
- Immediately frees allocated space
- Available for other users
- Helps manage device capacity
- Reduces storage pressure

### What is NOT Affected

**Cloud Data**
- User's Azure AD/Entra ID account
- User's cloud-stored documents
- User's OneDrive data
- User's email
- User's cloud app data
- User's other devices

**Device Configuration**
- Device enrollment
- MDM policies
- Installed apps
- Device settings
- Other cached users
- Network configuration

### Common Use Cases

| Scenario | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **User Departure** | Employee/student left organization | Complete removal from devices |
| **Storage Management** | Free space for active users | Improve device capacity |
| **Roster Management** | Remove users no longer assigned | Keep user lists current |
| **Max Users Reached** | Hit maximum cached users limit | Make room for new users |
| **Account Cleanup** | Regular maintenance | Optimize device performance |
| **Graduation/Termination** | End of tenure | Proper offboarding |

### Requirements

#### Device Requirements
- iPad in Shared iPad mode
- Supervised via DEP/ABM
- iPadOS 9.3 or later
- Online connectivity
- Managed by Intune

#### User Requirements
- User exists in device's cached user list
- Valid user principal name (UPN)
- Managed Apple ID or federated account

#### Action-Specific
- Can delete currently logged-in users (forces logout)
- Can delete multiple users from multiple devices
- Per-device operation (doesn't affect user globally)

### Data Deletion Process

**Immediate Actions**
1. User logged out if currently active
2. User removed from device roster
3. Cached data deletion begins
4. Storage space freed up
5. User cannot log back in

**Data Removal**
- User profile deleted
- Documents removed
- Photos deleted
- App data cleared
- Downloaded content removed
- Preferences erased

**Timeline**
- Deletion begins immediately
- Full removal takes 1-5 minutes
- Storage space available instantly
- No recovery possible

### User Impact

**For Deleted User**
- **Access**: Cannot log into this specific device
- **Data**: All cached data on device is lost
- **Cloud**: Cloud data unaffected
- **Other Devices**: Can still use other devices
- **Re-Addition**: Can be re-added, but starts fresh

**For Other Users**
- No impact on their accounts
- May see improved performance
- More storage available
- Uninterrupted access

**For Device**
- Frees storage space
- One fewer cached user
- Performance may improve
- Ready for new user

### Best Practices

**Before Deletion**
- Verify user has backed up important data
- Confirm user identity and device
- Document business justification
- Check if user needs re-addition later
- Consider logout instead if temporary

**Communication**
- Notify users before deletion
- Explain data loss implications
- Provide data backup instructions
- Set expectations for re-addition
- Follow organizational policies

**Planning**
- Delete during off-hours when possible
- Batch related operations
- Monitor storage impact
- Track deleted users
- Document deletion reasons

**Storage Management**
- Remove inactive users first
- Monitor device capacity
- Balance user count vs storage
- Plan for new user additions
- Regular maintenance schedule

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Action fails | User not on device | Verify user exists in device roster |
| No effect | Wrong device type | Confirm device is Shared iPad |
| Timeout | Device offline | Check network connectivity |
| Error | Not supervised | Enroll via DEP/ABM |
| User remains | Not Shared mode | Verify Shared iPad configuration |
| Storage not freed | Deletion in progress | Wait 5 minutes for completion |

### Recovery and Re-Addition

**No Recovery**
- Deleted data cannot be recovered
- Operation is permanent
- User must start fresh if re-added

**Re-Adding Users**
1. User can be re-added to device
2. Will start with clean profile
3. Must download all data again
4. Settings must be reconfigured
5. Treated as new user on device

**Alternative Approaches**
- Use logout for temporary removal
- Use wipe for complete device reset
- Consider user data backup before deletion
- Plan for re-addition if needed

### Shared iPad Mode Context

**User Management**
- Maximum users per device (typically 24-40)
- Storage allocation per user
- Quota management
- Active vs cached users
- User pruning strategies

**Storage Allocation**
- Each user gets allocated space
- Deletion frees that allocation
- Space available immediately
- Helps manage device capacity
- Prevents storage exhaustion

**Multi-User Environment**
- Multiple students/employees per device
- Individual user experiences
- Separate data and settings
- Managed user switching
- IT control over user roster
