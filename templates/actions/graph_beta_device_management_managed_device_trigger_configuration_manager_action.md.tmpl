### What is Configuration Manager Action Triggering?

Configuration Manager Action Triggering is an action that:
- Sends commands to the Configuration Manager client on Windows devices
- Triggers specific Configuration Manager operations remotely
- Works with co-managed devices (Intune + Configuration Manager)
- Enables immediate execution of Configuration Manager actions
- Supports policy refresh, app evaluation, antivirus scans, and more
- Provides bridge between Intune and Configuration Manager management

### Available Configuration Manager Actions

| Action | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **refreshMachinePolicy** | Refresh device machine-level policies | After policy changes in Configuration Manager |
| **refreshUserPolicy** | Refresh current user's policies | After user-specific policy updates |
| **wakeUpClient** | Wake up Configuration Manager client | Before scheduled operations or maintenance |
| **appEvaluation** | Trigger application deployment evaluation | After deploying new applications |
| **quickScan** | Windows Defender quick antivirus scan | Routine security checks |
| **fullScan** | Windows Defender full antivirus scan | Comprehensive security scanning |
| **windowsDefenderUpdateSignatures** | Update Windows Defender signatures | Before performing antivirus scans |

### When to Trigger Configuration Manager Actions

- After making policy or configuration changes in Configuration Manager
- To force immediate application deployment evaluation
- Before scheduled maintenance windows to ensure devices are ready
- During security incident response for immediate scans
- To update antivirus definitions across devices
- When troubleshooting device configuration issues
- To synchronize device state with Configuration Manager immediately

### What Happens When Action is Triggered

- Intune sends the trigger command to the device
- Configuration Manager client on the device receives the trigger
- Client queues or executes the requested action
- Action runs according to client schedule and configuration
- No response data is returned (204 No Content)
- Monitor results in Configuration Manager console or device logs
