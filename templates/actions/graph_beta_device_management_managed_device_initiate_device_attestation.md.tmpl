## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Support | Requirements |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Full Support | TPM 1.2 or 2.0, Secure Boot enabled, UEFI firmware |
| **macOS** | ❌ Not Supported | Device attestation is Windows-specific |
| **iOS/iPadOS** | ❌ Not Supported | Device attestation is Windows-specific |
| **Android** | ❌ Not Supported | Device attestation is Windows-specific |

### What is Device Attestation?

Device attestation is a security process that:
- Uses the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to cryptographically verify device state
- Validates boot integrity and firmware configuration
- Confirms device has not been tampered with or compromised
- Creates attestation report with cryptographic proof of device health
- Enables hardware-rooted chain of trust from boot to runtime
- Provides foundation for Zero Trust security architecture
- Does not affect device operation or user experience

### How Device Attestation Works

1. **TPM Measurement**: During boot, TPM measures and records each component
2. **Attestation Request**: Intune requests attestation from the device
3. **TPM Response**: Device TPM creates cryptographic proof of measurements
4. **Cloud Verification**: Azure attestation service validates TPM response
5. **Health Report**: Attestation result stored in device record
6. **Policy Enforcement**: Conditional access uses attestation for decisions

### TPM (Trusted Platform Module)

**What is TPM?**
- Hardware security chip integrated on motherboard
- Provides cryptographic operations and secure storage
- Stores keys, passwords, and digital certificates
- Creates and uses encryption keys in hardware
- Measures boot process and system state

**TPM Versions:**
| Version | Released | Capabilities | Windows Support |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **TPM 1.2** | 2005 | SHA-1, 2048-bit RSA | Windows 7+ |
| **TPM 2.0** | 2014 | SHA-256, ECC, enhanced algorithms | Windows 8.1+, required for Windows 11 |

**TPM Functions:**
- Platform integrity measurement
- Cryptographic key generation and storage
- Secure boot validation
- BitLocker disk encryption
- Credential Guard protection
- Device attestation

### Attestation vs Other Security Features

| Feature | Purpose | TPM Required | Scope |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Device Attestation** | Verify device health | ✅ Yes | Boot + firmware |
| **BitLocker** | Disk encryption | ✅ Yes | Data protection |
| **Secure Boot** | Boot integrity | ✅ Yes | Boot process |
| **Credential Guard** | Credential isolation | ✅ Yes | Authentication |
| **Device Guard** | Code integrity | ✅ Yes | Application execution |

### When to Initiate Device Attestation

- **Conditional Access Enforcement**: Verify device health before granting access
- **Zero Trust Implementation**: Validate "never trust, always verify" principle
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure devices meet security baselines
- **Post-Incident Recovery**: Verify device integrity after security event
- **Periodic Validation**: Regular health checks (monthly/quarterly)
- **Pre-Deployment**: Validate new devices before user assignment
- **Policy Changes**: Re-verify after security policy updates

### Attestation Results and Usage

**What Gets Validated:**
- Boot integrity (measured boot)
- Code integrity (secure boot)
- BitLocker encryption status
- Anti-malware status (early-launch)
- TPM health and presence
- Firmware configuration
- Security boot configuration

**How Results Are Used:**
- **Conditional Access**: Block/allow access based on device health
- **Compliance Policies**: Mark devices as compliant/non-compliant
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculate device risk level
- **Reporting**: Security posture dashboards
- **Automation**: Trigger remediation workflows
- **Auditing**: Compliance evidence and audit trails

### Zero Trust and Device Attestation

**Zero Trust Principles:**
1. **Verify explicitly**: Attestation provides cryptographic proof
2. **Least privilege access**: Grant based on attested device health
3. **Assume breach**: Continuous validation, not one-time trust

**Device Attestation in Zero Trust:**
- Validates device identity and integrity
- Provides continuous trust verification
- Enables risk-based access decisions
- Supports "never trust, always verify" model
- Creates hardware-rooted chain of trust

### Important Considerations

✅ **Safe Operations:**
- Does not affect device performance
- No user downtime or interruption
- No data collection or transmission
- Can be run anytime on any device
- Idempotent (safe to run repeatedly)

⚠️ **Requirements:**
- TPM 1.2 or 2.0 must be present and enabled
- Secure Boot must be enabled
- UEFI firmware (not legacy BIOS)
- Device must be online and checking in
- Windows 8.1 or later for full support

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **No TPM Present/Disabled**
   - Solution: Enable TPM in UEFI/BIOS settings
   - Check: Device Manager → Security devices

2. **Secure Boot Not Enabled**
   - Solution: Enable in UEFI firmware settings
   - Verify: `msinfo32` → Secure Boot State

3. **Attestation Fails**
   - Solution: Check TPM health, clear TPM if needed
   - Command: `Get-Tpm` in PowerShell

4. **Legacy BIOS Mode**
   - Solution: Convert to UEFI (may require Windows reinstall)
   - Check: `msinfo32` → BIOS Mode

### Best Practices

**Operational:**
- ✅ Initiate attestation during device enrollment
- ✅ Schedule periodic attestation (monthly recommended)
- ✅ Re-attest after firmware/BIOS updates
- ✅ Monitor attestation success rates
- ✅ Document attestation requirements
- ✅ Test conditional access policies with attestation

**Security:**
- ✅ Use attestation for conditional access decisions
- ✅ Implement risk-based access policies
- ✅ Monitor for attestation failures (potential tampering)
- ✅ Combine with other security signals
- ✅ Regular TPM health validation
- ✅ Investigate repeated attestation failures

**Compliance:**
- ✅ Document attestation as security control
- ✅ Include in audit evidence
- ✅ Regular compliance validation
- ✅ Track attestation coverage across fleet
- ✅ Report on attestation status
- ✅ Maintain attestation audit logs
