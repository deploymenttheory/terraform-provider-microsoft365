## Example Usage

### Basic Configuration Refresh Pause

{{ tffile "examples/actions/graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_pause_configuration_refresh/action.tf" }}

## API Permissions

The following [Microsoft Graph API permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) are required to use this action:

### Read Permissions
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`

### Write Permissions
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`

## Authentication Mechanism

This action uses the configured Microsoft 365 provider authentication. Ensure you have properly configured the provider with appropriate credentials and permissions.

## Important Notes

### Pause Duration
- **Minimum**: 1 minute
- **Maximum**: 1440 minutes (24 hours)
- **Auto-Resume**: Configuration refresh automatically resumes after the pause period expires
- **Cannot Extend**: Once initiated, the pause duration cannot be extended. You must wait for it to expire and re-pause if needed.

### What Gets Paused
Configuration refresh pause prevents the following from being applied to devices:
- New policy deployments
- Policy updates and changes
- Configuration profile updates
- Application deployment policy changes
- Compliance policy updates
- Settings catalog changes

### What Does NOT Get Paused
The following continue to operate normally during the pause:
- **Existing Policies**: All previously applied policies remain in effect
- **Device Check-Ins**: Devices continue checking in and reporting status
- **Manual Syncs**: Users can manually sync from the Company Portal app
- **Critical Updates**: Critical security updates may still be applied
- **Remote Actions**: Emergency actions (wipe, lock, locate) still work
- **Compliance Evaluation**: Compliance checks continue with existing policies

### Common Use Cases

#### Maintenance Windows
Pause configuration refresh during scheduled maintenance to prevent policy changes from interfering:
- Application updates (60-120 minutes)
- System upgrades (240-480 minutes)
- Infrastructure changes (240-480 minutes)

#### Troubleshooting
Temporarily freeze configuration to investigate issues:
- Policy conflict investigation (360-720 minutes)
- Performance issue isolation (240-360 minutes)
- Application compatibility testing (480-720 minutes)
- Rollback procedures (120-240 minutes)

#### Business-Critical Operations
Prevent policy changes during critical business operations:
- Trading floor operations (480 minutes)
- Retail POS systems (600 minutes)
- Medical device operations (720 minutes)
- Manufacturing floor (480-720 minutes)

#### Testing and Staging
Maintain stable configuration during testing phases:
- User acceptance testing (1440 minutes)
- Pilot deployments (720-1440 minutes)
- Policy validation (480-720 minutes)
- Staged rollouts (varies)

#### Incident Response
Freeze configuration during security investigations:
- Forensic analysis (480-720 minutes)
- Containment phase (360-480 minutes)
- Evidence collection (240-360 minutes)

### Best Practices

1. **Minimum Necessary Duration**
   - Use the shortest pause duration that meets your needs
   - Avoid unnecessary extended pauses
   - Plan ahead for anticipated maintenance duration

2. **Communication and Documentation**
   - Document the reason for pausing in change management systems
   - Notify affected teams and stakeholders
   - Track pause start and end times
   - Document any issues encountered

3. **Monitoring During Pause**
   - Monitor device status and health
   - Watch for user-reported issues
   - Check for critical security alerts
   - Verify devices remain compliant

4. **Post-Pause Actions**
   - Verify configuration refresh has resumed
   - Check for pending policy updates
   - Monitor for successful policy application
   - Review device compliance status

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Balance operational needs with security requirements
   - Don't pause during active security incidents (unless for containment)
   - Consider compliance implications
   - Document security exceptions if applicable

### Platform Support
- **Windows 10/11**: Fully supported
- **Earlier Windows versions**: Not supported
- **Non-Windows platforms**: Not applicable

### Compliance Considerations
- Pausing configuration refresh may temporarily affect compliance reporting
- Existing security policies remain enforced
- Document all pauses for audit purposes
- Consider regulatory requirements before pausing
- Some compliance frameworks may require approval for pauses

### Limitations and Constraints
- **Maximum Pause**: 24 hours (1440 minutes)
- **No Extension**: Cannot extend an active pause
- **Windows Only**: Only works on Windows 10/11 devices
- **Policy Type**: Affects Intune policies only (not SCCM in co-managed scenarios)
- **Emergency Actions**: Some critical updates may override the pause

### Monitoring and Validation
After initiating a pause, you should:
1. Verify the pause is active on target devices
2. Monitor for any unexpected policy applications
3. Check device check-in status
4. Review error logs if sync attempts occur
5. Confirm automatic resume after pause expires
