### What is Shared iPad Mode?

Shared iPad is an Apple educational and enterprise feature that enables:

**Multi-User Support**
- Multiple users can use the same physical iPad
- Each user maintains separate data, apps, and settings
- Users log in with Apple ID or Managed Apple ID
- Seamless switching between user accounts

**Local Data Caching**
- User data cached locally on device
- Offline access to user content
- Configurable storage per user
- Automatic cloud sync when online

**Management Features**
- Requires supervised iPads
- Must be enrolled via DEP/ABM
- Centralized configuration
- IT control over user quotas
- Session management capabilities

### How This Action Works

**Immediate Effect**
1. Active user is logged out
2. All user apps are closed
3. Device returns to login screen
4. Next user can immediately log in

**Data Preservation**
- User data remains cached on device
- Documents and files preserved
- App data saved
- User settings retained
- Photos and media kept
- User can re-login anytime

**What Doesn't Change**
- Device configuration
- Installed apps
- MDM enrollment
- Other cached users
- Device settings
- Network configuration

### Common Use Cases

| Scenario | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Classroom Rotation** | Switch students between periods | Efficient device sharing |
| **Lab Management** | Reset devices between sessions | Clean slate for each user |
| **Cart Devices** | Prepare devices for next day | Ready for morning distribution |
| **Emergency Logout** | Remote user session termination | Security/troubleshooting |
| **Scheduled Sessions** | Enforce time-limited access | Automated session management |
| **Device Rotation** | Prepare for next user in queue | Streamlined user switching |

### Requirements

#### Device Requirements
- iPad with Shared iPad mode enabled
- Supervised via DEP/ABM or Apple Configurator
- iPadOS 9.3 or later
- Sufficient storage for cached users
- Online (for remote command delivery)

#### User Requirements
- User must be actively logged in
- Uses Apple ID or Managed Apple ID
- Has active session on device

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager
- MDM (Intune) enrollment
- Managed Apple ID infrastructure (for education)
- Federation setup (for enterprise, optional)

### Action Behavior

#### Success Scenarios
- User logged out successfully
- Device returns to login screen
- User data preserved on device
- Ready for next user

#### No Effect Scenarios
- Regular (non-shared) iPad
- No user currently logged in
- Device already at login screen
- Device is iPhone (iOS)
- Unsupervised device

#### Failure Scenarios
- Device offline
- Device not in Shared iPad mode
- API communication error
- Insufficient permissions
- Device not supervised

### User Impact

**Immediate**
- Active user session terminated
- All apps close immediately
- Unsaved work is lost
- Device locks to login screen

**Data Impact**
- **Preserved**: User documents, photos, app data, settings
- **Lost**: Unsaved changes in open apps, clipboard content
- **Unaffected**: Other cached users, device configuration

**User Experience**
- Abrupt logout (no warning)
- Must log in again to access data
- All data available upon re-login
- No data loss (except unsaved work)

### Best Practices

**Scheduling**
- Logout during non-instructional time
- Coordinate with class schedules
- Use during breaks/transitions
- Avoid mid-session logouts

**Communication**
- Notify users before logout when possible
- Establish logout policies
- Train users to save work regularly
- Document standard procedures

**Implementation**
- Test with single device first
- Start with small groups
- Monitor for issues
- Have rollback plan
- Provide help desk support

**Automation**
- Integrate with scheduling systems
- Use time-based triggers
- Combine with other MDM actions
- Log all logout operations
- Monitor success rates

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Action fails | Device not Shared iPad | Verify Shared iPad configuration |
| No effect | No active user | Confirm user is logged in |
| Timeout | Device offline | Check network connectivity |
| Error | Not supervised | Enroll via DEP/ABM |
| Wrong device | iPhone (iOS) | Only use with iPadOS devices |
| User data lost | Unsaved work | Train users to save frequently |

### Shared iPad Configuration

1. Apple School Manager or Business Manager account
2. DEP/ABM enrollment for iPads
3. Shared iPad configuration profile
