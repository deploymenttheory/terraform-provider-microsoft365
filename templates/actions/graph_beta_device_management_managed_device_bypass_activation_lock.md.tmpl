## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Support | Requirements |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **iOS** | ✅ Full Support | iOS 7.1+, supervised devices only |
| **iPadOS** | ✅ Full Support | Supervised devices only |
| **macOS** | ✅ Full Support | macOS 10.11+, DEP/ABM enrolled |
| **Windows** | ❌ Not Supported | Activation Lock is Apple-only |
| **Android** | ❌ Not Supported | Activation Lock is Apple-only |

### What is Activation Lock?

Activation Lock is an Apple security feature that:
- Prevents unauthorized device reactivation after factory reset
- Automatically enabled when Find My iPhone/iPad/Mac is turned on
- Requires original Apple ID and password to reactivate
- Links device to specific Apple ID

### How Bypass Works

1. Issue bypass command via this action
2. Intune generates unique bypass code for device
3. Bypass code stored in Intune device properties
4. Retrieve code from Intune admin portal
5. Factory reset/wipe the device
6. During setup, device shows Activation Lock screen
7. Enter bypass code to unlock device
8. Device completes setup without user's Apple ID

### Important Considerations

- **Supervised iOS/iPadOS**: Devices must be supervised (DEP/ABM or Apple Configurator)
- **macOS DEP**: Best results with DEP/ABM enrolled macOS devices
- **Code Security**: Bypass codes are sensitive credentials - treat like passwords
- **Single Use**: Bypass code only works for specific device it was generated for
- **Physical Access**: Code must be entered during device setup at Activation Lock screen
