### What is FileVault Key Rotation?

FileVault Key Rotation is an action that:
- Generates a new FileVault personal recovery key
- Automatically escrows the new key with Intune
- Invalidates the previous recovery key
- Operates without user interaction
- Enhances security through regular key changes
- Maintains continuous disk encryption protection

### When to Rotate FileVault Keys

- Regular compliance-driven rotation (quarterly/annually per security policy)
- After suspected recovery key compromise or exposure
- When reassigning devices to new users or departments
- As part of security incident response procedures
- Before or after employee termination or transfer
- To meet regulatory or audit requirements
- After key has been accessed by administrative staff

### What Happens When FileVault Key is Rotated

- Intune sends rotation command to the macOS device
- Device generates new unique FileVault recovery key
- New key is automatically escrowed with Intune
- Previous recovery key is invalidated immediately
- Process completes without user interaction or awareness
- No device restart or user password change required
- Disk encryption continues without interruption
- New key becomes available in Intune portal for admin access
