## Use Cases

This action is critical for maintaining BitLocker encryption security and compliance across Windows devices:

## API Documentation

- [Microsoft Graph API - Rotate BitLocker Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/intune-devices-manageddevice-rotatebitlockerkeys?view=graph-rest-beta)

## Permissions

The following Microsoft Graph API permissions are required to use this action:

| Permission Type | Permissions (Least Privileged) |
|:----------------|:------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account) | DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All, DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported |
| Application | DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All, DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All |

~> **Note:** This action requires both device configuration and device management write permissions as it modifies BitLocker encryption settings.

## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.33.0-alpha | Experimental | Initial release |
| v0.40.0-alpha | Experimental | Example fixes and refactored sync progress logic |

## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

This remote action is only available for Windows devices with BitLocker encryption enabled. The table below shows platform support:

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|:---------|:----------|:------|
| **Windows 10** | ✅ | Pro, Enterprise, Education (Version 1703 or later) |
| **Windows 11** | ✅ | All editions with BitLocker support |
| **Windows Server** | ⚠️ | Limited support - depends on BitLocker availability |
| **macOS** | ❌ | Not supported - uses FileVault, not BitLocker |
| **iOS** | ❌ | Not supported - no BitLocker equivalent |
| **iPadOS** | ❌ | Not supported - no BitLocker equivalent |
| **Android** | ❌ | Not supported - uses device encryption, not BitLocker |
| **Android Enterprise** | ❌ | Not supported - uses device encryption, not BitLocker |
| **ChromeOS** | ❌ | Not supported - uses verified boot, not BitLocker |

### Important Considerations

**Key Rotation Fundamentals:**
- **Recovery Keys Only**: This action rotates BitLocker **recovery passwords/keys**, NOT the full-volume encryption keys
- **No Re-Encryption**: Data on the drive is NOT re-encrypted; the operation completes quickly (typically seconds to minutes)
- **Previous Keys Invalid**: All previous recovery keys become immediately invalid and cannot be used for recovery
- **New Key Escrow**: New recovery keys are automatically escrowed to both Intune and Azure AD
- **Cannot Be Undone**: Key rotation is permanent; there is no way to restore previous recovery keys
- **Multiple Drives**: Rotates keys for all BitLocker-protected drives on the device (OS, fixed data, removable drives if configured)

**Device Requirements:**
- **BitLocker Enabled**: Devices must have BitLocker encryption fully enabled and operational
- **Online Status**: Devices must be online and connected to Intune to receive the rotation command
- **Network Connectivity**: Devices need network access to communicate with Intune and Azure AD
- **TPM Chip**: Devices typically require TPM 1.2 or 2.0 chip (depending on Windows version and policy)
- **Windows Edition**: Must be Pro, Enterprise, or Education edition (Home edition does not support BitLocker)
- **Management State**: Devices must be actively enrolled and managed by Intune (not stale or orphaned)

**Operational Impact:**
- **No User Impact**: Key rotation is transparent to end users; no notifications or prompts
- **No Restart Required**: Devices do NOT need to be restarted for key rotation to complete
- **No Performance Impact**: Minimal to no performance impact during rotation (no data re-encryption)
- **Quick Operation**: Rotation typically completes in seconds to a few minutes per device
- **Background Process**: Rotation runs as a background system process without user interaction
- **Session Continuity**: User sessions remain active; no interruption to work

**Key Retrieval & Access:**
- **Intune Admin Center**: New keys viewable at Devices > All devices > [device name] > Recovery keys
- **Azure AD Portal**: New keys viewable at Devices > All devices > [device name] > BitLocker keys
- **Azure AD PowerShell**: Keys retrievable via `Get-AzureADDeviceBitLockerKey` cmdlet
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Keys accessible via `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{id}/recoveryKeys` endpoint
- **RBAC Permissions**: Requires appropriate permissions to view recovery keys in portals
- **Audit Logging**: Key access is logged in Azure AD and Intune audit logs

**BitLocker Recovery Scenarios:**
- **When Keys Needed**: Recovery keys required when BitLocker enters recovery mode (forgotten password, hardware changes, etc.)
- **Key Format**: Recovery keys are 48-digit numerical passwords (8 groups of 6 digits)
- **Key ID**: Each key has a unique Key ID (GUID) to identify which key protector it belongs to
- **Multiple Protectors**: Devices may have multiple key protectors; rotation affects recovery password protector
- **TPM Protector**: TPM-based protectors (primary unlock method) are NOT affected by this action

**Co-Management Considerations:**
- **Dual Escrow**: Co-managed devices can escrow keys to both Intune and Configuration Manager
- **SCCM Integration**: Ensure Configuration Manager BitLocker management policies align with Intune
- **Authority Conflicts**: Verify which system (Intune or SCCM) has authority for BitLocker management
- **Key Synchronization**: Keys may take time to synchronize between Intune and Configuration Manager
- **Policy Precedence**: Understand which policies take precedence in co-management scenarios

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Regular Rotation Schedule**: Implement quarterly or bi-annual key rotation for all managed Windows devices
- **Document Procedures**: Maintain documented processes for key rotation and emergency key retrieval
- **Test Key Retrieval**: Regularly test the process of retrieving and using recovery keys from Intune/Azure AD
- **Access Controls**: Limit access to BitLocker recovery keys to authorized security and helpdesk personnel only
- **Audit Reviews**: Regularly review audit logs for unauthorized key access attempts
- **Incident Response**: Include key rotation in security incident response playbooks
- **Key Backup**: Ensure key escrow is functioning before performing mass rotations
- **Staged Approach**: For large-scale rotations (500+ devices), use a phased rollout approach
- **Device Validation**: Verify device online status and BitLocker health before initiating rotation
- **Post-Rotation Verification**: Confirm new keys are properly escrowed after rotation completes

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- **Offline Devices**: Rotation fails if device is offline; device will receive command when it reconnects
- **BitLocker Not Enabled**: Rotation fails if BitLocker is not enabled; check BitLocker status first
- **TPM Issues**: Rotation may fail if TPM is locked, disabled, or in maintenance mode
- **Policy Conflicts**: Conflicting BitLocker policies can prevent successful key rotation
- **MBAM Conflicts**: Legacy MBAM (Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring) configurations may interfere
- **Key Escrow Failures**: Network or connectivity issues can prevent new keys from being escrowed properly
- **Permissions Issues**: Insufficient permissions can cause rotation to fail silently
- **Timing**: Allow several minutes for rotation to complete on busy or slow devices

**Compliance & Audit:**
- **Audit Trail**: All key rotation operations are logged in Intune and Azure AD audit logs
- **Compliance Reporting**: Use Intune compliance reports to track BitLocker encryption status
- **Key Age Tracking**: Monitor when keys were last rotated to ensure compliance with rotation policies
- **Evidence Collection**: Audit logs provide evidence of key rotation for compliance audits
- **Retention**: Ensure audit log retention meets your compliance requirements (typically 90-180 days)
