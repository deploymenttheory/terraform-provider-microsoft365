### How Remote Lock Works

- Command sent to device immediately if online
- Device locks screen instantly upon receiving command
- User must enter existing passcode to unlock
- Lock is enforced by operating system
- Command queued if device offline
- Device locks when it next checks in
- No data is erased, device remains functional once unlocked

### Common Use Cases

- Lost device scenarios
- Stolen device immediate response
- Security incident response
- Unauthorized device access prevention
- Compliance enforcement
- Compromised credential response
- Emergency device isolation
- User-requested device locking

### User Impact

- Screen locks immediately
- Existing passcode required to unlock
- No data loss
- Notifications may still appear on lock screen
- Device remains connected to network
- Background processes continue
- No warning provided to user

### Best Practices

- Document reason for lock in incident log
- Combine with locate device for lost devices
- Follow up with user communication
- Consider lost mode for iOS/iPadOS devices
- Use as first step in security incident response
- Monitor device status after lock command
- Have unlock procedure documented
- Consider follow-up actions (wipe, retire) if needed
