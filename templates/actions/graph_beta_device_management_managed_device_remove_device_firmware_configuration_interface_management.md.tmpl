## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.33.0-alpha | Experimental | Initial release |

## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Support | Requirements |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Conditional | DFCI-capable firmware (Surface, select OEM devices) |
| **macOS** | ❌ Not Supported | DFCI is Windows-specific technology |
| **iOS/iPadOS** | ❌ Not Supported | DFCI is Windows-specific technology |
| **Android** | ❌ Not Supported | DFCI is Windows-specific technology |

### What is DFCI?

**Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI)** is a technology that:
- Enables cloud-based management of UEFI (BIOS) settings on Windows devices
- Provides firmware-level security controls managed through Intune
- Works at a lower level than traditional MDM management
- Helps protect devices from unauthorized firmware changes
- Primarily available on Surface devices and select OEM devices
- Requires specific firmware support from the device manufacturer

### What is DFCI Management Removal?

Removing DFCI management is an action that:
- Disables Intune's ability to manage UEFI/BIOS settings remotely
- Removes firmware-level configuration control
- **Does not** unenroll the device from Intune
- **Does not** affect standard MDM management
- Reverts device to local firmware configuration only
- Typically cannot be easily reversed without physical device access
- Maintains all other Intune management capabilities

### DFCI Management States

| State | UEFI Remote Management | Standard MDM | Use Case |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|----------|
| **DFCI Enabled** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full firmware + MDM control |
| **DFCI Removed** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Standard MDM only |
| **Unenrolled** | ❌ No | ❌ No | No Intune management |

### When to Remove DFCI Management

- **Decommissioning devices** from DFCI-enabled fleet
- **Transitioning to standard management** for devices that don't require firmware control
- **Preparing devices for transfer** to different organization or user
- **Troubleshooting DFCI-related issues** that prevent device operation
- **Removing firmware restrictions** for specific use cases
- **Preparing devices for resale** or repurposing

### What Happens When DFCI is Removed

1. **Immediate**: API request is processed by Microsoft Graph
2. **Device Contact**: Device receives DFCI removal command at next check-in
3. **Firmware Update**: Device firmware processes DFCI removal
4. **Management Change**: Remote UEFI configuration is disabled
5. **MDM Continues**: Standard Intune MDM management remains active
6. **User Impact**: Minimal - device continues normal operation

### Compatible Devices

DFCI management is primarily available on:

**Microsoft Surface Devices:**
- Surface Pro 7 and later
- Surface Laptop 3 and later
- Surface Book 3 and later
- Surface Go 2 and later
- Surface Studio 2+ and later

**Select OEM Devices:**
- Certain HP, Dell, Lenovo enterprise models with DFCI firmware support
- Check with device manufacturer for DFCI compatibility

### Important Considerations

⚠️ **Critical Points:**

1. **Irreversible Without Physical Access**: Once DFCI is removed remotely, re-enabling it may require physical device access
2. **Not the Same as Unenrollment**: Device remains enrolled in Intune with full MDM management
3. **Firmware Control Lost**: UEFI/BIOS settings can no longer be managed remotely
4. **Security Implications**: Consider impact on device security posture before removal
5. **Planning Required**: Ensure you understand why DFCI is being removed

### DFCI vs Standard MDM

| Feature | DFCI Management | Standard MDM |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Operating System Settings** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Applications** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Policies** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **UEFI/BIOS Settings** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Boot Configuration** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Firmware Protection** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

### Re-enabling DFCI After Removal

To re-enable DFCI after removal:

1. **Physical Access Required**: Typically need physical device access
2. **UEFI Configuration**: May need to reset DFCI settings in UEFI
3. **Re-enrollment**: May require device re-enrollment or reset
4. **Manufacturer Support**: Consult device manufacturer documentation
5. **Complex Process**: Not a simple remote action
