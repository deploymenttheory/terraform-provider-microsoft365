## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |

## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Managed Devices | Co-Managed Devices | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support | Fastest sync response |
| **macOS** | ✅ Full Support | ❌ Not Applicable | Supervised devices recommended |
| **iOS** | ✅ Full Support | ❌ Not Applicable | Supervised devices recommended |
| **iPadOS** | ✅ Full Support | ❌ Not Applicable | Supervised devices recommended |
| **Android** | ✅ Full Support | ❌ Not Applicable | Includes Android Enterprise |
| **ChromeOS** | ❌ Not Supported | ❌ Not Applicable | Not available for ChromeOS devices |

### Managed vs Co-Managed Devices

| Device Type | Management | Sync Endpoint | Typical Use Case |
|------------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Managed** | Intune only | `/managedDevices/{id}/syncDevice` | BYOD, mobile devices, cloud-only management |
| **Co-Managed** | Intune + ConfigMgr | `/comanagedDevices/{id}/syncDevice` | Enterprise Windows devices, hybrid management |

### Co-Management Context

**What is Co-Management?**
- Windows devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM)
- Workloads split between the two management platforms
- Provides gradual transition from ConfigMgr to Intune
- Typically Windows 10/11 enterprise devices

**How Sync Works with Co-Management**
- Sync affects only Intune-managed workloads
- ConfigMgr workloads use ConfigMgr sync mechanisms
- Device must be enrolled in both systems
- Sync status visible in both consoles

**Co-Management Workloads**
- Compliance policies → Intune or ConfigMgr
- Device configuration → Intune or ConfigMgr
- Endpoint Protection → Intune or ConfigMgr
- Resource access → Intune or ConfigMgr
- Windows Update policies → Intune or ConfigMgr
- Office Click-to-Run apps → Intune or ConfigMgr

### What Happens During Sync

**Immediate Actions**
1. Device receives sync command (if online)
2. Initiates check-in with Intune
3. Downloads latest policy assignments
4. Evaluates compliance state
5. Downloads assigned applications
6. Reports updated inventory
7. Processes queued remote actions
8. Updates device status in console

**Policy Application**
- New policies downloaded and applied
- Changed policies updated immediately
- Removed policies uninstalled
- Configuration profiles refreshed
- Compliance evaluated
- Conditional access re-checked

**Application Management**
- Required apps downloaded/installed
- Available apps catalog updated
- App assignments processed
- App configuration applied
- App protection policies refreshed

**Device Inventory**
- Hardware information updated
- Software inventory refreshed
- Installed apps reported
- Disk space usage updated
- Battery status (mobile devices)
- Network information

### Check-In Intervals

| Scenario | Check-In Frequency | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Normal** | Every 8 hours | Default for most platforms |
| **iOS/iPadOS** | Every 6-8 hours | May vary by iOS version |
| **Android** | Every 8 hours | Enterprise devices |
| **Windows** | Every 8 hours | Can be customized via policy |
| **macOS** | Every 8 hours | Supervised devices |
| **Sync Action** | 1-5 minutes | Forces immediate check-in |

### Sync Behavior

**Online Devices**
- Receive command immediately
- Begin sync within 1-5 minutes
- Complete sync within 5-15 minutes
- Status updated in real-time

**Offline Devices**
- Sync command queued
- Executed when device comes online
- Queued for up to 7 days
- Auto-removed if expired

**Multiple Syncs**
- Avoid syncing same device repeatedly
- Wait 15+ minutes between syncs
- Multiple syncs may queue
- Can delay processing

**Network Requirements**
- Internet connectivity required
- Access to Intune endpoints
- Firewall rules must permit traffic
- VPN may impact sync speed

### Use Cases

| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Policy Deployment** | Force new policies to apply immediately | Policies active within minutes |
| **App Installation** | Push required apps urgently | Apps install on next check-in |
| **Compliance Evaluation** | Re-check device compliance | Updated compliance state |
| **Troubleshooting** | Verify policy deployment | See real-time status |
| **Emergency Updates** | Critical security updates | Immediate application |
| **New Enrollments** | Ensure fresh devices get all policies | Complete configuration |
| **User Account Changes** | Apply new user-specific policies | Updated user context |
| **Inventory Update** | Refresh device information | Current device state |

### Best Practices

**When to Sync**
- After creating new policies
- After modifying existing policies
- When troubleshooting deployment issues
- For critical security updates
- After device enrollment
- When verifying policy application

**When NOT to Sync**
- Repeatedly within short periods (< 15 min)
- For large numbers of offline devices
- During normal operations (let auto-sync work)
- For policies that can wait for normal sync
- On metered/slow networks unnecessarily

**Planning Considerations**
- Sync during business hours for online devices
- Schedule bulk syncs during off-hours
- Consider network bandwidth impact
- Allow time for completion (1-5 min per device)
- Monitor sync status in Intune admin center
- Document reason for manual sync

**Performance Optimization**
- Batch related devices together
- Use datasources to target specific groups
- Avoid duplicate device IDs
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Monitor for failed syncs
- Re-sync failures individually

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Sync fails | Device offline | Wait for device to come online |
| Timeout | Too many devices | Reduce batch size or increase timeout |
| Device not found | Invalid device ID | Verify device exists in Intune |
| Permission denied | Insufficient permissions | Check API permissions |
| Sync queued | Device offline | Command will execute when online |
| No effect | Wrong device type | Check managed vs co-managed |
| Slow sync | Network issues | Check network connectivity |
| Repeated failures | Device enrollment issue | Re-enroll device |

### Monitoring Sync Status

**Intune Admin Center**
1. Navigate to Devices → All devices
2. Select specific device
3. View "Last check-in" timestamp
4. Check "Device sync status"
5. Review "Pending actions"

**Terraform**
- Action reports success/failure
- Check diagnostics for errors
- Review progress messages
- Monitor timeout settings

**Time to Complete**
- Initial command: < 1 minute
- Device check-in: 1-5 minutes
- Policy application: 5-15 minutes
- Complete refresh: 15-30 minutes

### Limitations

**Technical Limits**
- Devices must be online
- Requires network connectivity
- Subject to API rate limits
- Maximum concurrent syncs per tenant
- Queued commands expire after 7 days

**Platform Limits**
- ChromeOS sync may be delayed
- Some policies require reboot
- App installation depends on size
- Compliance evaluation takes time
- Inventory update is not instant

**Co-Management Limits**
- Only affects Intune workloads
- ConfigMgr workloads not triggered
- Workload assignment matters
- Both systems must be healthy
