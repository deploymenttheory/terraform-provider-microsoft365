## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.33.0-alpha | Experimental | Initial release |

## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Support | Requirements |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Full Support | All versions including Home |
| **macOS** | ✅ Supported | User-approved MDM or supervised |
| **iOS** | ⚠️ Limited | Supervised devices only, uncommon |
| **iPadOS** | ⚠️ Limited | Supervised devices only, uncommon |
| **Android** | ❌ Not Supported | Shutdown not available |

### ⚠️ Critical Warning

**SHUTDOWN POWERS DEVICES OFF COMPLETELY**
- Devices will NOT restart automatically
- Physical access required to power devices back on
- More disruptive than reboot
- Use with extreme caution
- Consider reboot action if devices need to come back online

### Shutdown vs Reboot

| Action | Result | Recovery | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Shutdown** | Powers off | Manual restart required | Long-term offline, energy conservation |
| **Reboot** | Restarts | Automatic (2-5 min) | Updates, troubleshooting, config changes |

### Common Use Cases

- Energy conservation (weekends, holidays)
- Security incident response (device isolation)
- Hardware maintenance requiring full power-off
- Decommissioning devices before storage/shipment
- Emergency response to prevent data exfiltration
- Scheduled shutdowns for lab/classroom devices
- Extended maintenance periods
- Device preparation for physical relocation

### User Impact - CRITICAL

- Users lose ALL unsaved work
- Device becomes COMPLETELY unavailable
- Physical access required to restart
- Significant productivity loss possible
- Users cannot access device remotely
- Active sessions terminated immediately
- No automatic recovery
- Device remains offline indefinitely

### Best Practices

- ONLY use when devices must remain offline
- Ensure physical access available for restart
- Notify users well in advance
- Schedule for end of day or weekends
- Document reason in change management
- Verify device location (ensure accessible)
- **Consider reboot instead whenever possible**
- Test with small groups first
- Have rollback plan (manual power-on procedure)

### Prerequisites Before Shutdown

- Confirm physical access for power-on
- User notification completed
- Business justification documented
- Management approval (if required)
- Backup power-on procedure ready
- Contact information for on-site staff
- Emergency access plan

### Alternatives to Consider

- **Reboot**: If device needs to come back online
- **Sleep/Hibernate**: For temporary offline
- **Network isolation**: For security without full shutdown
- **Remote lock**: To prevent use without power-off
- **Lost mode**: For iOS/iPadOS devices
