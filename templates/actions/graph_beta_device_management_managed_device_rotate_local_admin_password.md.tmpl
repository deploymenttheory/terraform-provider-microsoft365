# {{.ProviderShortName}}_{{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Example Usage

### Basic - Managed Devices

{{ tffile "examples/actions/graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_rotate_local_admin_password/action.tf" }}

## API Permissions

The following [Microsoft Graph API permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) are required to use this action:

### Read Permissions
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`

### Write Permissions
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`

## Authentication Mechanism

This action uses the configured Microsoft 365 provider authentication. Ensure you have properly configured the provider with appropriate credentials and permissions.

## Important Notes

### Windows LAPS Requirements
- Devices must be Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Windows LAPS policy must be configured and assigned in Intune
- Policy must be active and applied on target devices
- Devices must support Windows LAPS (modern Windows versions)

### Password Generation and Storage
- Passwords are automatically generated as complex, random strings
- Length and complexity based on LAPS policy settings
- Stored securely in Azure AD or Intune
- Previous password immediately invalidated upon rotation
- Password history maintained for audit purposes

### Password Retrieval
- Only authorized administrators can retrieve passwords
- Retrieval requires specific Azure AD role permissions:
  - Cloud Device Administrator
  - Intune Administrator
  - Global Administrator
- Password retrieval actions are audited in Azure AD logs
- Passwords can be retrieved via:
  - Azure Portal (Azure AD > Devices)
  - Microsoft Graph API
  - Intune Admin Center

### Security Best Practices
1. **Regular Rotation Schedule**: Implement quarterly or semi-annual rotation
2. **Incident Response**: Rotate immediately after:
   - Administrator offboarding
   - Suspected credential compromise
   - Security incidents
   - Failed audit findings
3. **Access Control**: 
   - Limit password retrieval permissions
   - Enable MFA for password retrieval
   - Monitor retrieval events
4. **Zero Trust Alignment**:
   - Use just-in-time (JIT) password retrieval
   - Implement time-limited access
   - Regular rotation reduces exposure window

### Compliance Considerations
This action helps meet compliance requirements for:
- **PCI-DSS**: Privileged account password management
- **HIPAA**: Security rule for password controls
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Privileged access controls
- **NIST**: Password management and rotation after compromise
- **ISO 27001**: Information security controls for privileged access

### Platform Support
- **Windows 10/11**: Fully supported with Windows LAPS
- **Earlier Windows versions**: Not supported
- **Non-Windows platforms**: Not applicable (LAPS is Windows-specific)

### Operation Impact
- No device restart required
- No user interruption
- No service disruption
- Immediate effect on local administrator account
- Previous password becomes invalid immediately
