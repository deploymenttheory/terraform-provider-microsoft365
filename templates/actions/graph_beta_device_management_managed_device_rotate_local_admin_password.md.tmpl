### What is Windows LAPS Password Rotation?

Windows LAPS Password Rotation is an action that:
- Generates a new complex, random local administrator password
- Automatically stores the new password securely in Azure AD or Intune
- Invalidates the previous local administrator password
- Operates without user interaction or device restart
- Enhances security through regular credential changes
- Maintains audit trail of password changes

### When to Rotate Local Admin Passwords

- Regular compliance-driven rotation (quarterly/semi-annually per security policy)
- After suspected password compromise or exposure
- When reassigning devices to new users or departments
- As part of security incident response procedures
- Before or after employee termination or transfer (IT admin access)
- To meet regulatory or audit requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- After password has been accessed by administrative staff
- Following privilege escalation security incidents
- As required by Zero Trust security model

### What Happens When Password is Rotated

- Intune sends rotation command to the Windows device
- Device generates new complex password per LAPS policy settings
- New password is automatically escrowed with Azure AD/Intune
- Previous local administrator password is invalidated immediately
- Process completes without user interaction or awareness
- No device restart or user interruption required
- Password history is maintained for audit purposes
- New password becomes available in Intune portal for authorized admin retrieval

### Password Retrieval and Access

**Who Can Retrieve Passwords:**
- Only authorized administrators with specific Azure AD role permissions:
  - Cloud Device Administrator
  - Intune Administrator
  - Global Administrator

**How to Retrieve Passwords:**
- Azure Portal (Azure AD > Devices)
- Microsoft Graph API
- Intune Admin Center

**Security Measures:**
- Password retrieval actions are audited in Azure AD logs
- Passwords stored securely encrypted in Azure AD/Intune
- Just-in-time (JIT) retrieval model recommended
- Multi-factor authentication required for retrieval
- Time-limited access windows enforced

### Security Best Practices

- Implement regular rotation schedule (quarterly or semi-annual)
- Rotate immediately after administrator offboarding
- Rotate immediately after suspected credential compromise
- Limit password retrieval permissions to essential staff
- Enable MFA for all password retrieval operations
- Monitor and alert on password retrieval events
- Use just-in-time (JIT) password access patterns
- Implement time-limited access windows
- Regular rotation reduces credential exposure window
- Maintain audit logs for compliance requirements

### Compliance Considerations

This action helps meet compliance requirements for:

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PCI-DSS** | Privileged account password management and rotation |
| **HIPAA** | Security rule for password controls and privileged access |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Privileged access controls and credential management |
| **NIST** | Password management and rotation after compromise |
| **ISO 27001** | Information security controls for privileged access |

### Common Use Cases

- Scheduled compliance-driven password rotation
- Emergency password rotation after security incidents
- Device provisioning and deprovisioning workflows
- IT administrator offboarding procedures
- Privilege access management (PAM) integration
- Zero Trust security model implementation
- Audit preparation and remediation
- Security incident response and recovery
- Device reassignment to different users/departments
- Regular security hygiene maintenance
