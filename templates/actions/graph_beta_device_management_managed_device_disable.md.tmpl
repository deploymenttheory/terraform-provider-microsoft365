### What is Device Disable?

Device Disable is an action that:
- Temporarily suspends a device's ability to interact with Intune
- Prevents the device from syncing with Intune services
- Blocks policy application and updates
- Maintains the device's enrollment record in Intune
- Preserves all user data on the device
- Can be reversed by re-enabling the device
- Less permanent than retire or wipe actions
