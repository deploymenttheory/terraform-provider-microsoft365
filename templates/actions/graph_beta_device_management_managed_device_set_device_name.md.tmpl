### What is Set Device Name?

Set Device Name is an action that:
- Assigns custom names to managed devices
- Implements organizational naming conventions
- Improves device identification in Intune console
- Supports individual or bulk device renaming
- Applies changes after device check-in
- Works across all major device platforms

### When to Set Device Names

- Implementing standardized naming conventions organization-wide
- After reassigning devices to new users or departments
- Relocating devices to different offices or locations
- Replacing default or auto-generated device names
- Organizing devices by function, location, or ownership
- Making large device inventories easier to manage

### What Happens When Device Name is Set

- Intune sends rename command to the device
- Device applies new name after next check-in
- Name change appears in Intune admin console
- Time to apply varies by platform and check-in schedule
- Device must be online to receive command
- Some platforms may require device restart
- Original name is replaced with new custom name
