The community Microsoft 365 provider allows managing environments and other resources within [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/products-apps-services).

!> This code is made available as a experimental purposes only. Features are being actively developed and may have restricted or limited functionality. Future updates may introduce breaking changes, but we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to help mitigate this. The software may contain bugs, errors, or other issues that could cause service interruption or data loss. We recommend backing up your data and testing in non-production environments. Your feedback is valuable to us, so please share any issues or suggestions you encounter via GitHub issues or join our community Discord [server](https://discord.gg/Uq8zG6g7WE).

## Requirements

This provider requires a minimum of **Terraform >= 1.14.x.  For more information on provider installation and constraining provider versions, see the [Provider Requirements documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements).

## Installation

To use this provider, add the following to your Terraform configuration:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    microsoft365 = {
      source  = "deploymenttheory/microsoft365"
      version = "~> 0.40.0 # Replace with the latest version
    }
  }
}
```

See the official Terraform documentation for more information about [requiring providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements).

## Authenticating to Microsoft 365

This Terraform provider supports multiple authentication methods for accessing Microsoft 365 services. Each authentication method has specific use cases, 
benefits, and limitations. Please review the appropriate guide in the authentication section to determine which method best suits your deployment scenario.

Supported authentication methods include:

- Client Secret authentication
- Client Certificate authentication 
- Device Code authentication
- Interactive Browser authentication
- Workload Identity authentication
- Managed Identity authentication
- OIDC (generic) authentication
- GitHub OIDC authentication
- Azure DevOps OIDC authentication
- Azure Developer CLI authentication

## Using Environment Variables

We recommend using Environment Variables to pass the credentials to the provider.

## Environment Variables

The Microsoft 365 provider supports various environment variables for authentication and configuration. 
Using environment variables is recommended for sensitive information like client secrets and certificates.

## Additional Provider Configuration

The provider supports additional configuration options for client behavior, telemetry, and debugging:

```terraform
provider "microsoft365" {
  # ... authentication configuration ...
  
  debug_mode = false             # ENV: M365_DEBUG_MODE
  telemetry_optout = false       # ENV: M365_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT
  
  client_options = {
    # ... client configuration options ...
  }
}
```

For a complete list of client options, refer to the provider documentation.

> **Security Note**: Store sensitive values like client secrets, certificates, and passwords using environment variables or Terraform's encrypted state management features. Never commit these values directly in your configuration files.

# Resources and Data Sources

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

!> By calling `terraform destroy` all the resources that you've created will be permanently deleted. Please be careful with this command when working with production environments. You can use [prevent-destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy) lifecycle argument in your resources to prevent accidental deletion.  

## Examples

You can find practical examples of using this provider in our examples directory. These examples demonstrate:
- Basic resource management
