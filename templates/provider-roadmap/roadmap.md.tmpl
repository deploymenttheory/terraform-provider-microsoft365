# Microsoft 365 Provider Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Microsoft 365 Terraform Provider. It provides visibility into our implementation plans and priorities for upcoming releases.

## Understanding the Roadmap

This roadmap reflects our current planning and is subject to change based on customer feedback, technical challenges, and changes to the Microsoft Graph API. 

### Column Definitions

- **Resource Name**: The name of the Microsoft Graph resource as it appears in the API documentation.
- **Category**: The logical grouping of the resource (Device Management, App Management, Identity & Access, etc.).
- **API Path**: Whether the resource is available in the Microsoft Graph v1.0.0 endpoint or beta endpoint.
- **Status**: Current implementation status:
  - **Planned**: On our roadmap but work has not yet begun
  - **In Progress**: Development is currently underway
  - **Completed**: Implementation is finished and available in a released version
  - **Investigating**: We're researching the feasibility and approach
  - **Backlog**: A future consideration not actively planned for near-term releases
- **Priority**: The relative importance of this resource:
  - **High**: Critical functionality targeted for the next release
  - **Medium**: Important functionality planned for near-term releases
  - **Low**: Desirable but not prioritized for upcoming releases
- **Target Version**: The planned provider version where this resource will be available.
- **Dependencies**: Other resources or features that must be implemented first.
- **Notes**: Additional context, limitations, or implementation details.

## Feature Request Process

If you need a resource that is not currently on our roadmap or would like to see a particular resource prioritized, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-microsoft365/issues) with the "feature request" label.

## Release Schedule

We aim to release new versions on the following schedule:

- **Minor Releases (v1.x.0)**: Every 4-6 weeks
- **Patch Releases (v1.1.x)**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Major Releases (vX.0.0)**: When significant changes or breaking changes are introduced

Please note that this schedule is subject to change based on the scope of features, bug fixes, and community feedback.
