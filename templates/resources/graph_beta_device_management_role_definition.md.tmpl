## Important Notes

- **Role-Based Access Control**: This resource defines custom roles for Microsoft Intune role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Granular Permissions**: Allows creation of roles with specific permissions tailored to organizational needs.

- **Assignment Support**: Custom roles can be assigned to users and groups through role assignments.
- **Scope Management**: Works with scope tags to limit the scope of permissions within the organization.
