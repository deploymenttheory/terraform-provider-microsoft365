## Important Notes

- **Linux Settings Catalog**: This resource manages Linux platform scripts through the Intune Settings Catalog, not as standalone shell scripts.
- **Configuration Policies**: Linux scripts are deployed as device configuration policies using the settings catalog framework.
- **Script Execution**: Scripts are executed on Linux devices using the Microsoft Intune app for Linux.
- **User vs Root Context**: Scripts can run as the current user or with root/sudo privileges depending on configuration.
- **Assignment Required**: Policies must be assigned to device or user groups to be deployed.
- **Distribution Support**: Supports major Linux distributions including Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, and SUSE.
- **Policy Validation**: Intune provides configuration status reporting and logs for troubleshooting.
- **Return Codes**: Scripts should use appropriate exit codes to indicate success or failure.
- **Security Context**: Scripts running with elevated privileges should be carefully reviewed for security implications.
- **Settings Catalog Framework**: Uses the same underlying technology as Windows and macOS settings catalog policies.
- **Platform Requirements**: Requires Microsoft Intune app for Linux to be installed and enrolled.
