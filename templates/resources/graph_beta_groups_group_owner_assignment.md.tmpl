## Important Notes

- **Owner Type Support**: The types of owners that can be added depend on the target group type:
  - **Security Groups**: Users and Service principals
  - **Microsoft 365 Groups**: Users and Service principals
  - **Mail-enabled Security Groups**: Read-only, cannot add owners
  - **Distribution Groups**: Read-only, cannot add owners

- **Owner Permissions**: Group owners are allowed to modify the group object and can perform administrative tasks on the group.

- **Last Owner Protection**: The last owner (user object) of a group cannot be removed. Microsoft Graph API will prevent this operation.

- **Teams Integration**: If you update group owners for a group that has an associated Microsoft Teams team:
  - It can take up to 2 hours for the owners to be synchronized with Microsoft Teams
  - If you want the owner to be able to make changes in the team (e.g., creating a Planner plan), the owner also needs to be added as a group/team member

- **Object Type Validation**: The `owner_object_type` field determines the correct Microsoft Graph API endpoint to use:
  - `User`: Uses `/users/{id}` endpoint
  - `ServicePrincipal`: Uses `/servicePrincipals/{id}` endpoint

- **Permissions by Owner Type**: The same permissions are required for both owner types:
  - **Users**: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
  - **Service Principals**: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
  - **Role-assignable Groups**: Additional `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` permission required

- **Microsoft Entra Roles**: The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:
  - **Group owners** (can modify all types of group owners)
  - **Groups Administrator** (can modify all types of group owners)
  - **User Administrator** (can modify user owners only)
  - **Directory Writers** (can modify user owners only)
  - **Exchange Administrator** (Microsoft 365 groups only)
  - **SharePoint Administrator** (Microsoft 365 groups only)
  - **Teams Administrator** (Microsoft 365 groups only)
  - **Yammer Administrator** (Microsoft 365 groups only)
  - **Intune Administrator** (security groups only)

- **API Behavior**: The resource uses the `/groups/{group-id}/owners/$ref` endpoint with `@odata.id` references
- **Validation**: Client-side validation prevents common API errors and provides clear error messages
- **Composite ID**: The resource ID is automatically generated as `{group_id}/{owner_id}`
- **Idempotent**: The Microsoft Graph API handles duplicate owner additions appropriately

## Owner Type Compatibility Matrix

| Object Type | Security Group | Microsoft 365 Group | Mail-enabled Security | Distribution |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| User | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ❌ Read-only | ❌ Read-only |
| Service Principal | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ❌ Read-only | ❌ Read-only |

## Import

Group owner assignments can be imported using the composite ID format: `{group_id}/{owner_id}`

```bash
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_groups_group_owner_assignment.example "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321"
```

Where:
- `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012` is the group ID
- `87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321` is the owner ID
