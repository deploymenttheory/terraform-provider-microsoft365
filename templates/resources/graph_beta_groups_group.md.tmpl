## Important Notes

- **Group Types**: This resource supports security groups and Microsoft 365 groups.
- **Dynamic Membership**: Groups can have dynamic membership based on user or device attributes when `group_types` includes "DynamicMembership".
- **Role Assignment**: Groups can be made assignable to Entra ID roles by setting `is_assignable_to_role` to true. This property can only be set during creation and is immutable. Requires `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` permission.
- **Mail Features**: Microsoft 365 groups automatically get mail functionality when `mail_enabled` is true and `group_types` includes "Unified".
- **Visibility**: Controls who can see and join the group. Possible values: `Private`, `Public`, or `HiddenMembership`. Role-assignable groups are always `Private`.
- **Character Restrictions**: The `mail_nickname` field has strict character restrictions (ASCII only, excluding: @ () \\ [] " ; : <> , SPACE).
- **Length Limits**: Display names are limited to 256 characters, mail nicknames to 64 characters.
- **Owners and Members**: A maximum of 20 relationships (owners and members combined) can be added during group creation. Additional owners/members must be added after creation.
- **Description**: May be auto-populated by the API for certain group types (e.g., Microsoft 365 groups).
