- **Assignment Filters**: This resource creates filters that can be used to refine policy and app assignments to specific devices or users.
- **Filter Rules**: Use device properties like device model, OS version, or custom attributes to create targeted assignments.

- **Platform Support**: Filters support multiple device platforms including Windows, iOS, macOS, and Android.
- **Dynamic Targeting**: Provides dynamic targeting capabilities that automatically include/exclude devices as they meet filter criteria.
