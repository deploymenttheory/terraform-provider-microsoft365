## Important Notes

- **Policy Requirement**: A group lifecycle expiration policy must exist and have `managed_group_types` set to **Selected** before groups can be assigned to it.
- **Group Limitations**: When `managed_group_types` is set to **Selected**, you can assign up to 500 groups to the policy. If you need more than 500 groups, set the policy's `managed_group_types` to **All** instead.
- **Group Types**: This resource only works with Microsoft 365 groups (Unified groups). Security-only groups cannot be assigned to lifecycle policies.
- **Automatic Policy Discovery**: This resource automatically discovers the tenant's single lifecycle policy, so you don't need to specify a policy ID.
- **Expiration Management**: Once a group is assigned to a lifecycle policy, its `expirationDateTime` is automatically set based on the policy's `group_lifetime_in_days` value.
- **Renewal Notifications**: Group owners will receive renewal notifications 30 days, 15 days, and 1 day before the group expires. Owners must have Exchange licenses to receive these notifications.
- **Resource Replacement**: Changing the `group_id` requires destroying and recreating the assignment resource.
