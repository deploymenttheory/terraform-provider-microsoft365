## Important Notes

### Policy States
- **enabled**: The policy is active and will be enforced
- **disabled**: The policy exists but is not enforced
- **enabledForReportingButNotEnforced**: The policy will be evaluated and logged but not enforced (report-only mode)

### Applications
- Use `"All"` to target all cloud applications
- Use `"Office365"` to target all Office 365 applications
- Use specific application IDs for targeted policies
- Application filters support complex OData expressions for fine-grained control

### Users and Groups
- Use `"All"` to target all users
- Use `"GuestsOrExternalUsers"` to target external users
- Specify user, group, or role object IDs for targeted policies
- Emergency access accounts should always be excluded from blocking policies

### Locations
- Named locations must be created in Azure AD before referencing
- Use `"All"` for all locations or `"AllTrusted"` for all trusted locations
- IP-based and country-based locations are supported

### Client App Types
- `browser`: Web browsers
- `mobileAppsAndDesktopClients`: Mobile apps and desktop clients
- `exchangeActiveSync`: Exchange ActiveSync clients
- `other`: Other clients including legacy authentication

### Grant Controls
- **Operator**: `AND` requires all controls, `OR` requires any control
- **Built-in Controls**: `block`, `mfa`, `compliantDevice`, `domainJoinedDevice`, `approvedApplication`, `compliantApplication`, `passwordChange`
- **Authentication Strength**: Reference to custom authentication strength policies

### Session Controls
- **Application Restrictions**: Control access to specific applications
- **Cloud App Security**: Integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- **Sign-in Frequency**: Control how often users must re-authenticate
- **Persistent Browser**: Control browser session persistence
- **Continuous Access Evaluation**: Real-time policy evaluation

### Device Filters
- Support complex OData expressions for device-based conditions
- Common filters include device compliance, trust type, and device attributes
- Use `include` mode to target devices matching the filter
- Use `exclude` mode to exclude devices matching the filter

### Risk-based Policies
- **User Risk Levels**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `hidden`, `none`, `unknownFutureValue`
- **Sign-in Risk Levels**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `hidden`, `none`, `unknownFutureValue`
- Requires Azure AD Identity Protection licenses

### Best Practices
- Always exclude emergency access accounts from blocking policies
- Test policies in report-only mode before enabling enforcement
- Use specific targeting rather than broad "All" assignments when possible
- Monitor policy impact through Azure AD sign-in logs
- Implement a phased rollout for new policies
- Document policy purpose and expected behavior

### Common Policy Scenarios
- **Block Legacy Authentication**: Target legacy client app types with block control
- **Require MFA for Admins**: Target administrative roles with MFA requirement
- **Device Compliance**: Require compliant or domain-joined devices for access
- **Location-based Access**: Block or require additional controls based on location
- **Risk-based Access**: Respond to user or sign-in risk with appropriate controls
