## Important Notes

- **macOS Shell Scripts**: This resource manages shell scripts for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune using the deviceShellScript API.
- **Script Execution**: Scripts are executed on macOS devices using the Intune management agent (Microsoft Intune Agent.app).
- **User vs Root Context**: Scripts can run as the current user or with root privileges depending on configuration.
- **Assignment Required**: Scripts must be assigned to device or user groups to be deployed.
- **Script Validation**: Intune provides execution status reporting and logs for troubleshooting.
- **Return Codes**: Scripts should use appropriate exit codes to indicate success or failure.
- **Security Context**: Scripts running with root privileges should be carefully reviewed for security implications.
- **File Size Limits**: Script files must be less than 1 MB in size.
- **Execution Frequency**: Scripts can be configured to run once or repeatedly based on schedule settings.
- **Platform Support**: Supports macOS 12.0 and later versions with Intune management agent installed.
- **Shebang Requirement**: Scripts must begin with a proper shebang (#!/bin/sh, #!/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/env zsh).
