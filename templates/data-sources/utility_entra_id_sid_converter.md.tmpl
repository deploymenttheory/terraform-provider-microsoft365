# {{.Name}}

Converts between Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) Security Identifiers (SIDs) and Object IDs.

This utility performs bidirectional conversion - provide either a SID to get an Object ID, or an Object ID to get a SID. 
This is particularly useful for hybrid environments where on-premises Active Directory identities are synced to Entra ID,
and you need to correlate SIDs from on-premises systems with Object IDs in the cloud.

## Background

When on-premises Active Directory users, groups, or devices are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), 
they receive both a Security Identifier (SID) from the on-premises directory and an Object ID (GUID) in the cloud.
These identifiers are mathematically related through a specific conversion algorithm.
