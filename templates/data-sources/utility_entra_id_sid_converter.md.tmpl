# {{.Name}}

Converts between Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) Security Identifiers (SIDs) and Object IDs.

This utility performs bidirectional conversion - provide either a SID to get an Object ID, or an Object ID to get a SID. 
This is particularly useful for hybrid environments where on-premises Active Directory identities are synced to Entra ID,
and you need to correlate SIDs from on-premises systems with Object IDs in the cloud.

## Background

When on-premises Active Directory users, groups, or devices are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), 
they receive both a Security Identifier (SID) from the on-premises directory and an Object ID (GUID) in the cloud.
These identifiers are mathematically related through a specific conversion algorithm.

## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.35.0-alpha | Experimental | Initial release |

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/microsoft365_utility_entra_id_sid_converter/datasource.tf" }}

## Argument Reference

**Note:** Exactly one of `sid` or `object_id` must be provided.

* `sid` - (Optional) The Security Identifier (SID) in the format `S-1-12-1-<rid1>-<rid2>-<rid3>-<rid4>`. Provide this to convert to an Object ID. Each RID component must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295).
* `object_id` - (Optional) The Object ID (GUID) in the format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. Provide this to convert to a SID.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the argument provided, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of this resource (same as the input value).
* `sid` - The Security Identifier. If `object_id` was provided as input, this will be the converted SID.
* `object_id` - The Object ID (GUID). If `sid` was provided as input, this will be the converted Object ID.
