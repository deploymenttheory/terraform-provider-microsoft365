# {{.Name}}

A conditional gate valve for phased deployments that returns scope ID(s) only when specified time-based conditions are met.

This datasource enables controlled, time-based rollout of Microsoft 365 policies and configurations by acting as a deployment gate. 
It evaluates multiple conditions (time delays, business hours, maintenance windows, dependencies) and releases scope IDs 
(typically Entra ID Group GUIDs) only when all conditions are satisfied. When conditions are not met, it returns null, 
preventing deployment to target groups.

## Background

The datasource is evaluated on every `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. When conditions change and the gate opens,
the next apply will automatically assign policies to the released groups. This allows you to define your entire deployment
timeline upfront, and Terraform will progressively roll out changes as time passes.

**Key Concept**: Think of it as a time-locked vault. You set the conditions for when the vault opens, and it automatically
releases the contents (scope IDs) when those conditions are met.

## Use Cases

- **Phased Rollouts**: Deploy to Pilot → IT → Production with automatic timing and dependency chaining
- **Business Hours Only**: Restrict deployments to support hours (e.g., Monday-Friday 9 AM - 5 PM UTC)
- **Maintenance Windows**: Avoid deployments during weekends, nightly maintenance, or holiday freezes
- **Dependency Chaining**: Wait for previous phase to stabilize before proceeding to next phase
- **Emergency Releases**: Manual override for critical patches bypassing all scheduled conditions
- **Time-Limited Pilots**: Automatically expire pilot deployments after a specified duration
