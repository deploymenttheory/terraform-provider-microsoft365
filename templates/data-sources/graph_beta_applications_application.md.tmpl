## Microsoft Graph API Permissions

The following client `application` permissions are needed in order to use this {{.Type | lower}}:

**Required:**
- `Application.Read.All`
- `Directory.Read.All`

**Optional:**
- `None` `[N/A]`

## Important Notes

### OData Query Support

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` OData query parameters to help customize the response. Some queries are supported only when you use the ConsistencyLevel header set to eventual and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

**Important:** When using the `odata_query` attribute, provide only the filter expression itself without the `$filter=` prefix. For example:
- **Correct:** `odata_query = "displayName eq 'My Application'"`
- **Incorrect:** `odata_query = "$filter=displayName eq 'My Application'"`

### Key Credentials

By default, this API doesn't return the public key value of the key in the `keyCredentials` property unless `keyCredentials` is specified in a `$select` query. For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get `keyCredentials` for applications has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

### Retry and Consistency

This datasource implements automatic retry logic with up to 6 attempts over 60 seconds to handle eventual consistency in Microsoft Entra ID. This is particularly important when querying for applications that were recently created.

## Lookup Methods

This data source provides four mutually exclusive methods to query for an application:

1. **object_id**: Look up an application by its unique object ID (GUID). This is the most direct and efficient lookup method.
2. **app_id**: Look up an application by its application (client) ID (GUID). The system uses an OData filter internally.
3. **display_name**: Look up an application by its exact display name (case-sensitive). The system uses an OData filter internally.
4. **odata_query**: Use a custom OData `$filter` query for advanced filtering. Must return exactly one application.

You must specify exactly one of these attributes. Using multiple lookup methods simultaneously will result in a validation error.

### OData Query Examples

When using `odata_query`, you can use any valid OData filter expression without the `$filter=` prefix. The provider automatically applies the necessary OData parameters and headers (including ConsistencyLevel: eventual) when executing the query.

**Note:** Do not include `$filter=` in the `odata_query` value. Provide only the filter expression itself.
