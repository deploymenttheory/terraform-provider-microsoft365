# Pull Request Description

## Summary

Add support for iOS mobile app configuration management in Microsoft Intune through new Terraform resource and data source. This implementation enables Infrastructure as Code management of app-specific settings for managed iOS applications.

### Issue Reference

Fixes #[Issue Number]

### Motivation and Context

- **Why is this change needed?** Organizations managing iOS devices through Microsoft Intune need to configure app-specific settings programmatically through Terraform
- **What problem does it solve?** Enables automated deployment and management of iOS app configurations without manual portal intervention
- **Key capabilities:**
  - Create, update, and delete iOS mobile app configurations
  - Configure app settings using key-value pairs or XML
  - Assign configurations to user/device groups
  - Query existing configurations by ID or display name

### Dependencies

- Microsoft Graph API v1.0
- Existing Kiota SDK client
- No new external dependencies required
