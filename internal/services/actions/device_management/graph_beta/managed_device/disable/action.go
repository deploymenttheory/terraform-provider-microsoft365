		MarkdownDescription: "Disables managed devices from Intune management using the " +
			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/disable` and " +
			"`/deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/disable` endpoints. " +
			"This action disables a device's ability to interact with Intune services while maintaining its enrollment record. " +
			"Disabled devices cannot receive policies, sync with Intune, or perform managed operations until re-enabled. " +
			"This is useful for temporarily suspending device management without fully removing the device from Intune, " +
			"such as during investigations, compliance violations, or security incidents.\n\n" +
			"**Important Notes:**\n" +
			"- Device remains enrolled but cannot sync or receive policies\n" +
			"- Management operations are suspended\n" +
			"- Device can be re-enabled later\n" +
			"- Less permanent than retire or wipe\n" +
			"- Useful for temporary suspensions\n" +
			"- Security and compliance enforcement\n\n" +
			"**Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Security incident response (suspected compromise)\n" +
			"- Compliance violations requiring device suspension\n" +
			"- Temporary device quarantine\n" +
			"- Investigation of device issues\n" +
			"- Preventing policy application during troubleshooting\n" +
			"- Temporary management suspension\n\n" +
