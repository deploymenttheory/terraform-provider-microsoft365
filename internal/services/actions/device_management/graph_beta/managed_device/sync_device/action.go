		MarkdownDescription: "Forces managed and co-managed devices to immediately check in with Intune using the " +
			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/syncDevice` and " +
			"`/deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/syncDevice` endpoints. " +
			"This action triggers an immediate synchronization, causing devices to apply the latest policies, " +
			"configurations, and updates from Intune without waiting for the standard check-in interval.\n\n" +
			"**What This Action Does:**\n" +
			"- Forces immediate check-in with Intune\n" +
			"- Applies latest policies and configurations\n" +
			"- Downloads pending applications\n" +
			"- Reports updated device inventory\n" +
			"- Enforces compliance evaluation\n" +
			"- Processes queued remote actions\n" +
			"- Updates device status in console\n\n" +
			"**Managed vs Co-Managed Devices:**\n" +
			"- **Managed Devices**: Fully managed by Intune only\n" +
			"- **Co-Managed Devices**: Managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM)\n" +
			"- This action supports both types independently or together\n\n" +
			"**Platform Support:**\n" +
			"- **Windows**: Full support (managed and co-managed)\n" +
			"- **macOS**: Full support (managed only)\n" +
			"- **iOS/iPadOS**: Full support (managed only)\n" +
			"- **Android**: Full support (managed only)\n" +
			"- **ChromeOS**: Limited support\n\n" +
			"**Common Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Apply new policies immediately\n" +
			"- Force app installation/updates\n" +
			"- Trigger compliance re-evaluation\n" +
			"- Update device inventory quickly\n" +
			"- Verify policy deployment\n" +
			"- Troubleshoot deployment issues\n" +
			"- Emergency configuration changes\n\n" +
			"**Check-In Behavior:**\n" +
			"- Normal interval: Every 8 hours (varies by platform)\n" +
			"- This action: Immediate (within 1-5 minutes)\n" +
			"- Device must be online and powered on\n" +
			"- Network connectivity required\n" +
			"- Results visible in Intune admin center\n\n" +
			"**Important Considerations:**\n" +
			"- Device must be online to receive command\n" +
			"- Command queued if device is offline\n" +
			"- Sync completes when device comes online\n" +
			"- Multiple syncs in short period may delay each other\n" +
			"- No user disruption (background operation)\n\n" +
