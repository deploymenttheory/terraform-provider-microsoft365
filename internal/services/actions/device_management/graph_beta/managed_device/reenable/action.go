			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/reenable` and " +
			"`/deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/reenable` endpoints. " +
			"This action restores a disabled device's ability to interact with Intune services, allowing it to sync and " +
			"receive policy updates again. Re-enabling is the counterpart to the disable action and restores full management " +
			"capabilities to devices that were temporarily suspended. This is useful after resolving security incidents, " +
			"compliance violations, or completing investigations that required temporary device suspension.\n\n" +
			"**Important Notes:**\n" +
			"- Only works on previously disabled devices\n" +
			"- Restores sync capability with Intune\n" +
			"- Re-enables policy application\n" +
			"- Maintains existing enrollment\n" +
			"- Reverses the disable action\n" +
			"- All platforms supported\n\n" +
			"**Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Restoring devices after security investigation completion\n" +
			"- Re-enabling compliant devices after violations resolved\n" +
			"- Ending temporary quarantine period\n" +
			"- Resuming management after troubleshooting\n" +
			"- Restoring devices after policy fixes\n" +
			"- Completing incident response procedures\n\n" +
