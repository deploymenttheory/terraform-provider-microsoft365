		MarkdownDescription: "Triggers device location for one or more managed devices using the " +
			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/locateDevice` endpoint. " +
			"This action requests the device to report its current geographic location, which is then viewable " +
			"in the Microsoft Intune admin center. The locate device feature is essential for finding lost or " +
			"stolen devices and is commonly used in conjunction with lost mode.\n\n" +
			"**Important Notes:**\n" +
			"- Device must be online to receive and respond to the locate command\n" +
			"- Location services must be enabled on the device\n" +
			"- Device must have GPS/location hardware capability\n" +
			"- Location data is displayed in the Intune portal, not returned via API\n" +
			"- Multiple location requests can be sent over time to track device movement\n" +
			"- Location accuracy depends on device capabilities (GPS, WiFi, cellular triangulation)\n\n" +
			"**Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Locating lost or stolen devices\n" +
			"- Tracking devices in lost mode\n" +
			"- Verifying device location for security/compliance\n" +
			"- Finding devices before performing remote wipe\n" +
			"- Assisting users who have misplaced their devices\n" +
			"- Asset tracking and recovery operations\n\n" +
			"**Platform Support:**\n" +
			"- **iOS/iPadOS**: Fully supported (iOS 9.3+, supervised devices)\n" +
			"- **Android Enterprise**: Supported (fully managed, dedicated, and work profile devices)\n" +
			"- **macOS**: Supported (macOS 10.13+, supervised devices or user-approved MDM)\n" +
			"- **Windows**: Limited support (Windows 10/11 with location services enabled)\n\n" +
			"**Location Data:**\n" +
			"- Location data is displayed in the Intune admin center under device properties\n" +
			"- Shows latitude, longitude, altitude (if available)\n" +
			"- Includes location accuracy radius\n" +
			"- Displays timestamp of when location was captured\n" +
			"- Location history may be available depending on platform\n\n" +
			"**Privacy Considerations:**\n" +
			"- Users may receive notification that device location was requested\n" +
			"- Location tracking should comply with organizational privacy policies\n" +
			"- Document legitimate business reasons for location requests\n" +
			"- Consider legal requirements in your jurisdiction\n\n" +
