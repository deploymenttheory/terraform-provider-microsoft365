		MarkdownDescription: "Bypasses Activation Lock on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices using the " +
			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/bypassActivationLock` endpoint. " +
			"Activation Lock is an Apple security feature that prevents unauthorized use of a device after it has been erased. " +
			"When Find My iPhone/iPad/Mac is enabled and a device is erased, Activation Lock requires the original Apple ID " +
			"and password before the device can be reactivated. This action generates a bypass code that allows IT administrators " +
			"to reactivate managed devices without the user's Apple ID credentials.\n\n" +
			"**What is Activation Lock?**\n" +
			"- Security feature built into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS\n" +
			"- Automatically enabled when Find My iPhone/iPad/Mac is turned on\n" +
			"- Prevents device reactivation after factory reset without Apple ID credentials\n" +
			"- Helps prevent theft and unauthorized device reuse\n" +
			"- Links device to specific Apple ID\n\n" +
			"**Important Notes:**\n" +
			"- Device must be supervised (iOS/iPadOS) or enrolled via DEP/ABM (macOS)\n" +
			"- Activation Lock must currently be enabled on the device\n" +
			"- Generates a bypass code stored in Intune for future use\n" +
			"- Bypass code can be retrieved from device properties in Intune portal\n" +
			"- Code can be used during device setup to bypass Activation Lock screen\n" +
			"- Does not disable Find My iPhone/iPad/Mac, only provides bypass capability\n" +
			"- Bypass code remains valid until Activation Lock is disabled by user\n\n" +
			"**Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Wiping and reassigning corporate devices to new employees\n" +
			"- Recovering devices from departing employees who forgot to disable Find My\n" +
			"- Preparing devices for return to vendor or recycling\n" +
			"- Enabling IT to factory reset and redeploy devices\n" +
			"- Handling devices with lost or forgotten Apple ID credentials\n" +
			"- Bulk device preparation and provisioning\n\n" +
			"**Platform Support:**\n" +
			"- **iOS**: Supported (iOS 7.1+, supervised devices only)\n" +
			"- **iPadOS**: Supported (supervised devices only)\n" +
			"- **macOS**: Supported (macOS 10.11+, DEP/ABM enrolled devices)\n" +
			"- **Other Platforms**: Not supported (Activation Lock is Apple-only feature)\n\n" +
			"**How to Use Bypass Code:**\n" +
			"1. Issue bypass command via this action\n" +
			"2. Retrieve bypass code from Intune portal (device properties)\n" +
			"3. Erase/wipe the device (using wipe action or manually)\n" +
			"4. When device shows Activation Lock screen during setup\n" +
			"5. Enter bypass code in password field\n" +
			"6. Device will bypass Activation Lock and complete setup\n\n" +
			"**Workflow Example:**\n" +
			"```\n" +
			"1. Employee leaves organization with device in lost mode\n" +
			"2. IT issues bypass activation lock command (this action)\n" +
			"3. IT retrieves bypass code from Intune portal\n" +
			"4. IT wipes device (removes all data)\n" +
			"5. During setup, device shows Activation Lock screen\n" +
			"6. IT enters bypass code to unlock device\n" +
			"7. Device can now be re-enrolled and assigned to new user\n" +
			"```\n\n" +
			"**Security Considerations:**\n" +
			"- Bypass code should be treated as sensitive credential\n" +
			"- Only authorized IT staff should have access to bypass codes\n" +
			"- Document usage for compliance and audit purposes\n" +
			"- Consider implementing approval workflow for bypass requests\n" +
			"- Verify device ownership before issuing bypass\n" +
			"- Bypass does not affect device security after reactivation\n\n" +
			"**Limitations:**\n" +
			"- Cannot bypass Activation Lock on personal (non-supervised) iOS/iPadOS devices\n" +
			"- Cannot bypass Activation Lock on macOS devices not enrolled via DEP/ABM\n" +
			"- Bypass code only works for device it was generated for\n" +
			"- Must have Activation Lock bypass code retrieved before device is erased\n" +
			"- Some older device models may not support this feature\n\n" +
			"**Best Practices:**\n" +
			"- Issue bypass command before wiping device when possible\n" +
			"- Store bypass codes securely in password manager or secure vault\n" +
			"- Document which devices have bypass codes generated\n" +
			"- Include activation lock bypass in device offboarding procedures\n" +
			"- Test bypass process in controlled environment first\n" +
			"- Verify device supervision status before attempting bypass\n" +
			"- Consider enabling automatic bypass code escrow during enrollment\n\n" +
