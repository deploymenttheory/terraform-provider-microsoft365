		MarkdownDescription: "Performs a clean operation on Windows managed and co-managed devices using the " +
			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/cleanWindowsDevice` and " +
			"`/deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/cleanWindowsDevice` endpoints. " +
			"This action provides a lighter-weight alternative to full device wipe, allowing IT administrators " +
			"to remove applications and settings while optionally preserving user data on each device independently.\n\n" +
			"**What Clean Windows Device Does:**\n" +
			"- Removes installed applications (except inbox Windows apps)\n" +
			"- Removes user profiles (unless `keep_user_data` is true for that device)\n" +
			"- Removes device configuration settings\n" +
			"- Removes company policies and profiles\n" +
			"- Can preserve user data per-device if specified\n" +
			"- Device remains enrolled in Intune\n" +
			"- Less destructive than full wipe\n\n" +
			"**Platform Support:**\n" +
			"- **Windows**: Full support (Windows 10/11)\n" +
			"- **Other platforms**: Not supported (Windows-only action)\n\n" +
			"**Clean vs Wipe vs Retire:**\n" +
			"- **Clean**: Removes apps/settings, optionally keeps user data, device stays enrolled\n" +
			"- **Wipe**: Factory reset, removes all data, device must re-enroll\n" +
			"- **Retire**: Removes company data only, preserves personal data\n\n" +
			"**Common Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Device refresh without full rebuild\n" +
			"- Removing malware/unwanted applications\n" +
			"- Preparing device for new user (keeping OS)\n" +
			"- Troubleshooting device issues\n" +
			"- Compliance remediation\n" +
			"- Software bloat removal\n" +
			"- Maintaining device enrollment\n\n" +
			"**Important Considerations:**\n" +
			"- Device must be online to receive command\n" +
			"- User will lose unsaved work\n" +
			"- Installed applications will be removed\n" +
			"- Process may take several minutes\n" +
			"- Device remains in Intune (no re-enrollment needed)\n" +
			"- Each device can have different `keep_user_data` setting\n\n" +
