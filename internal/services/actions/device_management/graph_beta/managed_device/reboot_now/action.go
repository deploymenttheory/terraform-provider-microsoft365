		MarkdownDescription: "Remotely reboots managed devices using the " +
			"`/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/rebootNow` endpoint. " +
			"This action immediately restarts devices, which is essential for applying updates, " +
			"troubleshooting system issues, or ensuring configuration changes take effect. " +
			"The reboot command is sent to devices immediately if online, or queued for execution " +
			"when the device next checks in with Intune.\n\n" +
			"**Important Notes:**\n" +
			"- Device reboots immediately upon receiving command (if online)\n" +
			"- Any unsaved work on the device will be lost\n" +
			"- Users receive minimal or no warning before reboot\n" +
			"- Reboot is forceful and does not wait for user interaction\n" +
			"- Command is queued if device is offline\n" +
			"- Use with caution during business hours\n\n" +
			"**Use Cases:**\n" +
			"- Applying Windows updates that require restart\n" +
			"- Installing software that requires system reboot\n" +
			"- Troubleshooting devices with performance issues\n" +
			"- Forcing application of configuration profiles\n" +
			"- Clearing temporary system issues\n" +
			"- Maintenance windows for device refresh\n" +
			"- Resolving frozen or unresponsive remote devices\n" +
			"- Completing BitLocker encryption setup\n\n" +
			"**Platform Support:**\n" +
			"- **Windows**: Fully supported (Windows 10/11, including Home edition)\n" +
			"- **macOS**: Supported (requires user-approved MDM or supervised)\n" +
			"- **iOS/iPadOS**: Limited support (supervised devices only)\n" +
			"- **Android**: Not supported for reboot action\n\n" +
			"**Best Practices:**\n" +
			"- Schedule reboots during maintenance windows or off-hours\n" +
			"- Notify users in advance when possible\n" +
			"- Use for non-interactive devices (kiosks, shared devices)\n" +
			"- Consider user impact before rebooting during business hours\n" +
			"- Test with small device groups before bulk operations\n" +
			"- Document reason for reboot in change management system\n" +
			"- Combine with compliance policies for automated maintenance\n\n" +
			"**User Impact:**\n" +
			"- Users may lose unsaved work\n" +
			"- Active sessions are terminated\n" +
			"- Video calls and presentations are interrupted\n" +
			"- File transfers may be interrupted\n" +
			"- Users may not receive advance warning\n" +
			"- Device is unavailable for 2-5 minutes during restart\n\n" +
