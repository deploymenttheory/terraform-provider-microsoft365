# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# Clean vs Wipe vs Retire:
# - Clean: Removes apps/settings, optionally keeps user data, device stays enrolled
# - Wipe: Factory reset, removes all data, device must re-enroll
# - Retire: Removes company data only, preserves personal data
#
# keep_user_data Parameter (REQUIRED):
# - false: Removes user profiles and data (full cleanup)
# - true: Preserves user profiles and data (app cleanup only)
# - Must be explicitly set - no default value
#
# Platform Support:
# - Windows 10: Fully supported
# - Windows 11: Fully supported
# - Other platforms: Not supported (Windows-only action)
#
# What Gets Removed (when keep_user_data = false):
# - Installed applications (except inbox Windows apps)
# - User profiles
# - User data (documents, desktop, etc.)
# - Device configuration settings
# - Company policies and profiles
#
# What Gets Removed (when keep_user_data = true):
# - Installed applications (except inbox Windows apps)
# - Device configuration settings
# - Company policies and profiles
# - User profiles and data are PRESERVED
#
# What is Preserved (Always):
# - Windows OS installation
# - Intune enrollment
# - Device in Intune management
# - Inbox Windows applications
# - Device hardware configuration
#
# Common Use Cases:
# - keep_user_data = false:
#   * Device reassignment to new user
#   * Malware removal requiring full cleanup
#   * Compliance remediation
#   * Device refresh before new deployment
#   * Preparing device for return/disposal
#
# - keep_user_data = true:
#   * Application troubleshooting
#   * Software bloat removal
#   * Configuration reset
#   * Maintaining user environment
#   * Performance optimization
#
# Best Practices:
# - Test with small device groups first
# - Schedule during maintenance windows
# - Notify users before cleaning their devices
# - Use keep_user_data=true for user devices when possible
# - Use keep_user_data=false for device reassignment
# - Document business justification
# - Monitor device status after clean
# - Allow sufficient timeout (devices may take 10-20 minutes)
#
# User Impact:
# - Device will be unavailable during clean process
# - Unsaved work will be lost
# - Process typically takes 10-20 minutes
# - Device remains enrolled (no re-enrollment needed)
# - User can log back in after clean completes
# - With keep_user_data=true, user profile is intact
# - With keep_user_data=false, user profile is removed
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Device must be Windows 10 or Windows 11
# - Device must be online
# - Device must be enrolled in Intune
# - Sufficient admin permissions required
#
# After Clean Operation:
# - Device remains in Intune
# - Policies will reapply automatically
# - Applications must be reinstalled
# - Check device status in Intune admin center
# - User may need to reconfigure personal settings
# - Company Portal remains available
