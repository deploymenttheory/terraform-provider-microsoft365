# Important Notes:
#
# 1. Windows LAPS Requirements:
#    - Devices must be Windows 10/11
#    - Windows LAPS policy must be configured in Intune
#    - Policy must be assigned and active on target devices
#    - Devices must have checked in and applied the policy
#
# 2. Password Generation:
#    - Passwords automatically generated (complex, random)
#    - Length and complexity based on LAPS policy settings
#    - Stored securely in Azure AD or Intune
#    - Previous password immediately invalidated
#
# 3. Password Retrieval:
#    - Authorized administrators can retrieve passwords
#    - Access requires appropriate Azure AD permissions
#    - Retrieval actions are audited
#    - Passwords can be retrieved via Azure Portal or Graph API
#
# 4. Security Best Practices:
#    - Rotate passwords regularly (quarterly or semi-annually)
#    - Rotate immediately after admin offboarding
#    - Rotate after suspected compromise
#    - Rotate as part of incident response
#    - Document rotation schedule for compliance
#
# 5. Zero Trust Considerations:
#    - Align rotation with Zero Trust principles
#    - Use just-in-time (JIT) password retrieval
#    - Enable MFA for password retrieval
#    - Monitor password retrieval events
#    - Regular rotation reduces exposure window
#
# 6. Compliance Requirements:
#    - Many frameworks require regular password rotation
#    - NIST recommends rotation after compromise
#    - PCI-DSS requires periodic password changes
#    - HIPAA security rule requires password management
#    - SOC 2 Type II requires privileged access controls
