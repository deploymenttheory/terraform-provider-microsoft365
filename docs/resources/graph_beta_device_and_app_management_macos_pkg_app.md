- `minimum_supported_operating_system` (Attributes) Specifies the minimum macOS version required for the application. Each field indicates whether the version is supported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--macos_pkg_app--minimum_supported_operating_system))

Optional:

- `included_apps` (Attributes Set) Define the app bundle identifiers and version numbers to be used to detect the presence of the macOS app installation. This list is dynamically populated based on the PKG metadata, and users can also append additional entries. Maximum of 500 apps. +

### Notes: +
- Included app bundle IDs (`CFBundleIdentifier`) and build numbers (`CFBundleShortVersionString`) are used for detecting and monitoring app installation status of the uploaded file. +
- The list should **only** contain the application(s) installed by the uploaded file in the `/Applications` folder on macOS. +
- Any other type of file that is not an application or is not installed in the `/Applications` folder should **not** be included. +
- If the list contains files that are not applications or none of the listed apps are installed, app installation status will **not** report success. +
- When multiple apps are present in the PKG, the **first app** in the list is used to identify the application. +

### Example: +
To retrieve the `CFBundleIdentifier` and `CFBundleShortVersionString` of an installed application, you can use the macOS Terminal: +

```bash +
# Retrieve the Bundle Identifier +
defaults read /Applications/Company\ Portal.app/Contents/Info CFBundleIdentifier +

# Retrieve the Short Version String +
defaults read /Applications/Company\ Portal.app/Contents/Info CFBundleShortVersionString +
``` +

Alternatively, these values can also be located in the `<app_name>.app/Contents/Info.plist` file inside the mounted PKG or DMG. +
