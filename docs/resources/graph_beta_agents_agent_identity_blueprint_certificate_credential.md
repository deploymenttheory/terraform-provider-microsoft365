<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) The unique identifier of the agent identity blueprint application.
- `key` (String, Sensitive) The certificate's raw data in PEM format. Use `file("path/to/cert.pem")` to read the certificate file.

### Optional

- `display_name` (String) Friendly name for the certificate. Optional.
- `end_date_time` (String) The date and time at which the credential expires. The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2025 is 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z. Required.
- `replace_existing_certificates` (Boolean) When `true`, replaces all existing certificates on the application. When `false` (default), preserves existing certificates and adds the new one.
- `start_date_time` (String) The date and time at which the credential becomes valid. The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2024 is 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z. If not specified, defaults to the current time.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `type` (String) The type of key credential. Must be `AsymmetricX509Cert`.
- `usage` (String) A string that describes the purpose for which the key can be used. Must be `Verify`.

### Read-Only

- `custom_key_identifier` (String) A 40-character binary type that can be used to identify the credential. Optional. When not provided in the payload, defaults to the thumbprint of the certificate.
- `key_id` (String) The unique identifier (GUID) for the key credential.
- `thumbprint` (String) The thumbprint (SHA-1 hash) of the certificate.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
