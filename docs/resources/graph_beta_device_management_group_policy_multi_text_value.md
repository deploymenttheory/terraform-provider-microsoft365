## Schema

### Required

- `category_path` (String) The category path of the group policy definition (e.g., '\FSLogix\Profile Containers', '\FSLogix\ODFC Containers'). Used to distinguish between policies with the same name in different categories
- `class_type` (String) The class type of the group policy definition. Must be 'user' or 'machine'
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the group policy setting is enabled or disabled
- `group_policy_configuration_id` (String) The unique identifier of the group policy configuration that contains this presentation value
- `policy_name` (String) The display name of the group policy definition (e.g., 'Allow automatic full screen on specified sites')
- `values` (Set of String) A set of text values for the multi-text group policy setting

### Optional

- `presentation_index` (Number) The index of the presentation to use if multiple presentations exist for the policy (default: 0 - first suitable text presentation)
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The date and time when the presentation value was created
- `group_policy_definition_value_id` (String) The unique identifier of the group policy definition value instance within the configuration (resolved automatically from policy_name and class_type)
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the group policy presentation text value
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The date and time when the presentation value was last modified

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
