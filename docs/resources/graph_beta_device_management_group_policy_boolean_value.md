## Schema

### Required

- `category_path` (String) The category path of the group policy definition (e.g., '\FSLogix\Profile Containers', '\FSLogix\ODFC Containers'). Used to distinguish between policies with the same name in different categories
- `class_type` (String) The class type of the group policy definition. Must be 'user' or 'machine'
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the group policy setting is enabled or disabled
- `group_policy_configuration_id` (String) The unique identifier of the group policy configuration that contains this presentation value
- `policy_name` (String) The display name of the group policy definition (e.g., 'Allow automatic full screen on specified sites')
- `values` (Attributes List) List of boolean presentation values for this group policy definition. Each presentation corresponds to a different checkbox or setting within the policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--values))

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The date and time when the presentation value was created
- `group_policy_definition_value_id` (String) The unique identifier of the group policy definition value instance within the configuration (resolved automatically from policy_name and class_type)
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the group policy definition value (not individual presentation values)
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The date and time when the presentation value was last modified

<a id="nestedatt--values"></a>
### Nested Schema for `values`

Required:

- `value` (Boolean) The boolean value for this specific presentation

Optional:

- `presentation_id` (String) The unique identifier of the group policy presentation template. If not provided, presentations will be auto-resolved in order.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Resource Structure**: this resource deploys a text value for a group policy configuration. 
It has a hard dependency on the group policy configuration resource.
- **Authoring**: The policy name, class type, and category path must match what's defined in the Intune gui. The Provider
will resolve the correct template and presentation IDs for you. The boolean values should be in defined in the HCL
as to the order within the gui.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
