## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_identity_and_access_network_filtering_policy" "block_policy" {
  name        = "Block Malicious Traffic"
  description = "Policy to block malicious network traffic"
  action      = "block"
}

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_identity_and_access_network_filtering_policy" "allow_policy" {
  name        = "Allow Traffic from Trusted Sources"
  description = "Policy to allow traffic from trusted sources"
  action      = "allow"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `action` (String) The action to take when the policy is triggered. Possible values are: `block`, `allow`. Note: This is typically set during creation but can also be updated.
- `name` (String) The name of the filtering policy.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Maximum length is 1500 characters.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The creation date and time of the policy.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the filtering policy.
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The last modified date and time of the policy.
- `version` (String) The version of the policy. Note: This property is not documented in the Microsoft Graph API documentation but is included in API responses. This appears to be an internal property that tracks the policy structure version and does not change with regular updates.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
