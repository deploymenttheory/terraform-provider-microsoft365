## Schema

### Required

- `device_cleanup_rule_platform_type` (String) The managed device platform for which the admin wants to create the device cleanup rule. Possible values are: `all`, `androidAOSP`, `androidDeviceAdministrator`, `androidDedicatedAndFullyManagedCorporateOwnedWorkProfile`, `chromeOS`, `androidPersonallyOwnedWorkProfile`, `ios`, `macOS`, `windows`, `windowsHolographic`, `unknownFutureValue`.
- `device_inactivity_before_retirement_in_days` (Number) Number of days when the device has not contacted Intune before it gets automatically removed. Valid values are 0 to 2147483647.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the device cleanup rule.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description for the device cleanup rule.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the managed device cleanup rule.
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The date and time when the device cleanup rule was last modified. This property is read-only.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
