### Optional

- `enable_mem_auto_enroll` (Boolean) Specifies whether new Cloud PCs will be automatically enrolled in Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM). The default value is false.
- `enable_single_sign_on` (Boolean) True if the provisioned Cloud PC can be accessed by single sign-on. False indicates that the provisioned Cloud PC doesn't support this feature. Default value is false. Windows 365 users can use single sign-on to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID with passwordless options (for example, FIDO keys) to access their Cloud PC. Optional.
- `os_version` (String) The version of the operating system (OS) to provision on Cloud PCs. Possible values: windows10, windows11, unknownFutureValue.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `user_account_type` (String) The account type of the user on provisioned Cloud PCs. Possible values: standardUser, administrator, unknownFutureValue.
- `windows_settings` (Attributes) Represents the Cloud PC organization settings for a tenant. A tenant has only one cloudPcOrganizationSettings object. The default language value en-US. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--windows_settings))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The singleton ID for the Cloud PC organization settings.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Singleton Resource**: There is only one Cloud PC Organization Settings object per tenant.
- Most attributes are optional and have sensible defaults (see schema above).
- The `windows_settings.language` attribute defaults to `en-US` (English - United States) if not specified.
- Changing settings here affects all Cloud PCs in the tenant.
