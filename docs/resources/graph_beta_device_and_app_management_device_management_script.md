# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_device_management_script (Resource)

The resource `device_management_script` manages an Intune device management script

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Device Management Script Resource

# Data source for Azure AD group (assuming you have this data source available)
data "azuread_group" "example_group" {
  display_name = "Example Group"
}

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_device_management_script" "example" {
  display_name = "Example Device Management Script"
  description  = "This is an example device management script"

  # The actual script content (PowerShell in this example)
  script_content = <<EOT
    # Your PowerShell script here
    Write-Host "Hello from device management script!"
    # Add more PowerShell commands as needed
  EOT

  run_as_account           = "system"  # Can be "system" or "user"
  enforce_signature_check  = false
  file_name                = "example_script.ps1"
  run_as_32_bit            = false

  role_scope_tag_ids = ["tag1", "tag2"]

  # Example assignment
  assignments = {
    target = {
      target_type                                     = "user"
      device_and_app_management_assignment_filter_id   = "filter-id-123"
      device_and_app_management_assignment_filter_type = "include"
      entra_object_id                                  = "user-object-id-456"
    }
  }

  # Example group assignment
  group_assignments = {
    target_group_id = data.azuread_group.example_group.object_id
  }

  # Optional: Define custom timeouts
  timeouts = {
    create = "30m"
    read   = "10m"
    update = "30m"
    delete = "30m"
  }
}
