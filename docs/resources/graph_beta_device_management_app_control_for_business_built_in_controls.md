## Schema

### Required

- `enable_app_control` (String) Select Audit only to log all events in local client logs but not block any apps from running or select Enforce to actively block apps from running in a deployed App Control for Business base policy. App Control for Business policies created in either Audit only or Enforce mode will be deployed as rebootless base policies to all devices targeted. By default, any devices targeted with this App Control for Business policy will have the setting to Trust Windows components and Store apps enabled, in either audit or enforce mode based on your selection.
- `name` (String) Name of the App Control for Business policy.

### Optional

- `additional_rules_for_trusting_apps` (Set of String) By default, any devices targeted with this App Control for Business policy will have the setting to Trust Windows components and Store apps enabled, in either audit or enforce mode based on your selection.Further, you can optionally add some additional rules to your policy, such as selecting Trust apps with good reputation to allow reputable apps as defined by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to run.Select Trust apps from managed installers to allow apps deployed via authorized sources of application deployment (managed installers). The Intune management extension will be considered a managed installer if it has been set as such within your organization. Any apps not marked as coming from a managed installer will not be allowed to run.All other apps and files not specified by the rules in this App Control for Business policy will be audited only in local client logs (if Audit only is selected), or blocked (if Enforce is selected) from running on devices. Can include: 'trust_apps_with_good_reputation' - allows reputable apps as defined by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to run; 'trust_apps_from_managed_installers' - allows apps deployed via authorized sources of application deployment (managed installers).
- `assignments` (Attributes Set) Assignments for the device configuration. Each assignment specifies the target group and schedule for script execution. Supports group filters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assignments))
- `description` (String) Optional description for the App Control for Business policy.
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this App Control for Business policy.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the app control for business status.

<a id="nestedatt--assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of assignment target. Must be one of: 'allDevicesAssignmentTarget', 'allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget', 'groupAssignmentTarget', 'exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget'.

Optional:

- `filter_id` (String) ID of the filter to apply to the assignment.
- `filter_type` (String) Type of filter to apply. Must be one of: 'include', 'exclude', or 'none'.
- `group_id` (String) The Entra ID group ID to include or exclude in the assignment. Required when type is 'groupAssignmentTarget' or 'exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget'.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
