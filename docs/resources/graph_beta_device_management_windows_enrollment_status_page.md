## Schema

### Required

- `allow_device_reset_on_install_failure` (Boolean) Allow or block device reset on installation failure. When block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is true, this must be false. When block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is false, this can be true or false.
- `allow_device_use_on_install_failure` (Boolean) Allow the user to continue using the device on installation failure. When block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is true, this must be false. When block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is false, this can be true or false.
- `allow_log_collection_on_install_failure` (Boolean) Allow or block log collection on installation failure.
- `block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed` (Boolean) Allow the user to retry the setup on installation failure.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the enrollment status page configuration.
- `install_progress_timeout_in_minutes` (Number) Set installation progress timeout in minutes. Valid values are 1 to 1440 (24 hours).
- `install_quality_updates` (Boolean) Whether to install quality updates during the enrollment status page experience.
- `only_fail_selected_blocking_apps_in_technician_phase` (Boolean) When true, only the selected blocking apps will be failed in the technician phase. When block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is true, this must be false. When block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is false, this can be true or false.
- `only_show_page_to_devices_provisioned_by_out_of_box_experience_oobe` (Boolean) Only show autopilot status page during initial device setup and during first user sign in to devices provisioned by oobe.
- `show_installation_progress` (Boolean) Show or hide installation progress to user.

### Optional

- `custom_error_message` (String) Set custom message when time limit or error occurs during initial device setup.
- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Maximum length is 1500 characters.
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Settings Catalog template profile.
- `selected_mobile_app_ids` (Set of String) Selected applications to track the installation status. This collection can contain a maximum of 100 elements. Can only be used effectively when block_device_use_until_all_apps_and_profiles_are_installed is true.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the enrollment status page configuration.

<a id="nestedatt--assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of assignment target. Must be one of: 'allDevicesAssignmentTarget', 'allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget', 'groupAssignmentTarget'.

Optional:

- `group_id` (String) The Entra ID group ID to include or exclude in the assignment. Required when type is 'groupAssignmentTarget'.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
