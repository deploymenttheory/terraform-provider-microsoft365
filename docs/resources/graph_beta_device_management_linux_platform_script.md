### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Optional:

- `all_devices` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all devices. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all devices in the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices_filter_type` or `all_devices_filter_id`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users` and `all_users_filter_type` or `all_users_filter_id`.
- `all_devices_filter_id` (String) The ID of the device group filter to apply when `all_devices` is set to `true`. This should be a valid GUID of an existing device group filter.
- `all_devices_filter_type` (String) The filter type for all devices assignment. Valid values are:
- `include`: Apply the assignment to devices that match the filter.
- `exclude`: Do not apply the assignment to devices that match the filter.
- `none`: No filter applied.

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Linux Settings Catalog**: This resource manages Linux platform scripts through the Intune Settings Catalog, not as standalone shell scripts.
- **Configuration Policies**: Linux scripts are deployed as device configuration policies using the settings catalog framework.
- **Script Execution**: Scripts are executed on Linux devices using the Microsoft Intune app for Linux.
- **User vs Root Context**: Scripts can run as the current user or with root/sudo privileges depending on configuration.
- **Assignment Required**: Policies must be assigned to device or user groups to be deployed.
- **Distribution Support**: Supports major Linux distributions including Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, and SUSE.
- **Policy Validation**: Intune provides configuration status reporting and logs for troubleshooting.
- **Return Codes**: Scripts should use appropriate exit codes to indicate success or failure.
- **Security Context**: Scripts running with elevated privileges should be carefully reviewed for security implications.
- **Settings Catalog Framework**: Uses the same underlying technology as Windows and macOS settings catalog policies.
- **Platform Requirements**: Requires Microsoft Intune app for Linux to be installed and enrolled.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
