# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_linux_platform_script (Resource)

Manages an Intune Linux platform script using the 'configurationPolicies' Graph Beta API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_linux_platform_script" "example" {
  name                = "Example Linux Script"
  description         = "Example script to demonstrate Linux platform script configuration"
  execution_context   = "user" // Possible values are user, root
  execution_frequency = "1day" // Possible values are 1day, 3days, 5days, 1week
  execution_retries   = 2      // Can be one of: `15minutes`, `30minutes`, `1hour`, `2hour`, `3hour`, `6hour`, `12hour`, `1day`, or `1week`. Defaults to `15minutes`.

### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Optional:

- `all_devices` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all devices. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all devices in the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices_filter_type` or `all_devices_filter_id`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users` and `all_users_filter_type` or `all_users_filter_id`.
- `all_devices_filter_id` (String) The ID of the device group filter to apply when `all_devices` is set to `true`. This should be a valid GUID of an existing device group filter.
- `all_devices_filter_type` (String) The filter type for all devices assignment. Valid values are:
- `include`: Apply the assignment to devices that match the filter.
- `exclude`: Do not apply the assignment to devices that match the filter.
- `none`: No filter applied.
- `all_users` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all users. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all licensed users within the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users_filter_type` or `all_users_filter_id`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices` and `all_devices_filter_type` or `all_devices_filter_id`.
