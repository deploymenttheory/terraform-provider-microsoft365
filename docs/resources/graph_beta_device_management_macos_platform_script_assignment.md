## Schema

### Required

- `macos_platform_script_id` (String) The ID of the device management script to assign.
- `target` (Attributes) The assignment target. See [deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentTarget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-shared-deviceandappmanagementassignmenttarget?view=graph-rest-beta). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--target))

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the custom attribute shell script.

<a id="nestedatt--target"></a>
### Nested Schema for `target`

Required:

- `target_type` (String) The target group type for the script assignment. Possible values: `allDevices`, `allLicensedUsers`, `groupAssignment`.

Optional:

- `device_and_app_management_assignment_filter_id` (String) The Id of the scope filter applied to the target assignment.
- `device_and_app_management_assignment_filter_type` (String) The type of scope filter for the target assignment. Possible values: `include`, `exclude`, `none`.
- `group_id` (String) The Entra ID group ID for the assignment target. Required when target_type is 'groupAssignment'.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
