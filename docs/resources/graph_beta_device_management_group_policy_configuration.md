## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) User provided name for the resource object

### Optional

- `assignments` (Attributes Set) Assignments for the device configuration. Each assignment specifies the target group and schedule for script execution. Supports group filters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assignments))
- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Maximum length is 1500 characters.
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Group Policy Configuration.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The date and time the object was created
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the group policy configuration
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The date and time the entity was last modified
- `policy_configuration_ingestion_type` (String) Type of definitions configured for this policy. Possible values are: unknown, custom, builtIn, mixed, unknownFutureValue

<a id="nestedatt--assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of assignment target. Must be one of: 'allDevicesAssignmentTarget', 'allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget', 'groupAssignmentTarget', 'exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget'.

Optional:

- `filter_id` (String) ID of the filter to apply to the assignment.
- `filter_type` (String) Type of filter to apply. Must be one of: 'include', 'exclude', or 'none'.
- `group_id` (String) The Entra ID group ID to include or exclude in the assignment. Required when type is 'groupAssignmentTarget' or 'exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget'.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Resource Structure**: this resource deploys and manages the base group policy configuration object and the assignments 
for it. specific configuration items are deployed as separate resources. Please see `microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_group_policy_text_value`, 
`microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_group_policy_boolean_value` for more information.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
