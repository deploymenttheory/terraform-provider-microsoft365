## Schema

### Required

- `managed_app_protection_id` (String) The ID of the Windows managed app protection policy to associate this app with
- `mobile_app_identifier` (Attributes) The Windows app identifier information (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--mobile_app_identifier))

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `version` (String) The version of the managed mobile app

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this Windows managed mobile app

<a id="nestedatt--mobile_app_identifier"></a>
### Nested Schema for `mobile_app_identifier`

Required:

- `windows_app_id` (String) The Windows app identifier (e.g., Microsoft.WindowsApp_8wekyb3d8bbwe)


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
