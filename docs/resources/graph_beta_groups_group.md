## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display name for the group. This property is required when a group is created and can't be cleared during updates. Maximum length is 256 characters.
- `mail_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether the group is mail-enabled. Required.
- `mail_nickname` (String) The mail alias for the group, unique for Microsoft 365 groups in the organization. Maximum length is 64 characters. This property can contain only characters in the ASCII character set 0 - 127 except the following: @ () \ [] " ; : <> , SPACE.
- `security_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether the group is a security group. Required.

### Optional

- `classification` (String) Describes a classification for the group (such as low, medium, or high business impact). Valid values for this property are defined by creating a ClassificationList setting value, based on the template definition.
- `description` (String) An optional description for the group.
- `group_types` (Set of String) Specifies the group type and its membership. If the collection contains 'Unified', the group is a Microsoft 365 group; otherwise, it's either a security group or a distribution group. If the collection includes 'DynamicMembership', the group has dynamic membership; otherwise, membership is static.
- `is_assignable_to_role` (Boolean) Indicates whether this group can be assigned to a Microsoft Entra role. This property can only be set while creating the group and is immutable. If set to true, the securityEnabled property must also be set to true, visibility must be Hidden, and the group can't be a dynamic group. Default is false.
- `membership_rule` (String) The rule that determines members for this group if the group is a dynamic group (groupTypes contains DynamicMembership). For more information about the syntax of the membership rule, see Membership Rules syntax.
- `membership_rule_processing_state` (String) Indicates whether the dynamic membership processing is on or paused. Possible values are 'On' or 'Paused'. Default is 'Paused'.
- `preferred_data_location` (String) The preferred data location for the Microsoft 365 group. By default, the group inherits the group creator's preferred data location.
- `preferred_language` (String) The preferred language for a Microsoft 365 group. Should follow ISO 639-1 Code; for example, en-US.
- `theme` (String) Specifies a Microsoft 365 group's color theme. Possible values are Teal, Purple, Green, Blue, Pink, Orange, or Red.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `visibility` (String) Specifies the group join policy and group content visibility for groups. Possible values are: Private, Public, or HiddenMembership. Default is 'Private'.

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) Timestamp of when the group was created. The value can't be modified and is automatically populated when the group is created. Read-only.
- `expiration_date_time` (String) Timestamp of when the group is set to expire. It's null for security groups, but for Microsoft 365 groups, it represents when the group is set to expire as defined in the groupLifecyclePolicy. Read-only.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the group. Read-only.
- `mail` (String) The SMTP address for the group. Read-only.
- `on_premises_sync_enabled` (Boolean) true if this group is synced from an on-premises directory; false if this group was originally synced from an on-premises directory but is no longer synced; null if this object has never synced from an on-premises directory. Read-only.
- `proxy_addresses` (Set of String) Email addresses for the group that direct to the same group mailbox. Read-only.
- `renewed_date_time` (String) Timestamp of when the group was last renewed. This value can't be modified directly and is only updated via the renew service action. Read-only.
- `security_identifier` (String) Security identifier of the group, used in Windows scenarios. Read-only.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Group Types**: This resource supports security groups, Microsoft 365 groups, and distribution groups.
- **Dynamic Membership**: Groups can have dynamic membership based on user or device attributes when `group_types` includes "DynamicMembership".
- **Role Assignment**: Groups can be made assignable to Azure AD roles by setting `is_assignable_to_role` to true (only during creation).
- **Mail Features**: Microsoft 365 groups automatically get mail functionality when `mail_enabled` is true and `group_types` includes "Unified".
- **Visibility**: Controls who can see and join the group - Private, Public, or HiddenMembership.
- **Character Restrictions**: The `mail_nickname` field has strict character restrictions (ASCII only, excluding special characters).
- **Length Limits**: Display names are limited to 256 characters, mail nicknames to 64 characters.
- **Language Codes**: Preferred language should follow ISO 639-1 format (e.g., "en-US").
- **Theme Colors**: Available themes are Teal, Purple, Green, Blue, Pink, Orange, or Red.
- **Immutable Properties**: Some properties like `is_assignable_to_role` can only be set during creation.
