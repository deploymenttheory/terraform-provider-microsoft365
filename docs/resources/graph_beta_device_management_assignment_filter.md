  Manages assignment filters in Microsoft Intune using the /deviceManagement/assignmentFilters endpoint. Assignment filters enable granular targeting of policies and applications based on device properties like OS version, manufacturer, device name, or custom attributes, allowing more precise deployment control beyond basic group membership.

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display name of the assignment filter.
- `platform` (String) The Intune device management type (platform) for the assignment filter. This specifies the OS platform type for which the assignment filter will be applied.Must be one of the following values: android, androidForWork, iOS, macOS, windows10AndLater,androidAOSP, androidMobileApplicationManagement, iOSMobileApplicationManagement, windowsMobileApplicationManagement.
- `rule` (String) Rule definition of the assignment filter.

### Optional

- `assignment_filter_management_type` (String) Indicates filter is applied to either 'devices' or 'apps' management type. Possible values are: devices, apps, unknownFutureValue. Default filter will be applied to 'devices'.
- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Maximum length is 1500 characters.
- `role_scope_tags` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Settings Catalog template profile.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The creation time of the assignment filter.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the assignment filter.
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) Last modified time of the assignment filter.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Assignment Filters**: This resource creates filters that can be used to refine policy and app assignments to specific devices or users.
- **Filter Rules**: Use device properties like device model, OS version, or custom attributes to create targeted assignments.
- **Include/Exclude**: Filters can be used to include or exclude devices from policy assignments based on the defined criteria.
- **Platform Support**: Filters support multiple device platforms including Windows, iOS, macOS, and Android.
- **Dynamic Targeting**: Provides dynamic targeting capabilities that automatically include/exclude devices as they meet filter criteria.
- **Rule Syntax**: Filters use a specific rule syntax for defining conditions (e.g., device.model -eq "Surface Pro").
- **Assignment Flexibility**: Enhances the flexibility of Intune policy assignments beyond just group-based targeting.

## Common Filter Examples

- **Device Model**: `device.model -eq "Surface Pro 7"`
- **OS Version**: `device.osVersion -startsWith "10.0.19"`
- **Enrollment Type**: `device.enrollmentProfileName -eq "Corporate Devices"`
- **Device Category**: `device.deviceCategory -eq "Corporate"`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# {resource_id}
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_assignment_filter.example assignment-filter-id
