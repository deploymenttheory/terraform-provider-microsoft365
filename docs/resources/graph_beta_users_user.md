### Nested Schema for `password_profile`

Required:

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for the user. This property is required when a user is created. It can be updated, but the user will be required to change the password on the next login.

<a id="nestedatt--identities"></a>
### Nested Schema for `identities`

Required:

- `issuer` (String) The name of the identity provider.
- `issuer_assigned_id` (String) The unique identifier assigned to the user by the issuer.
- `sign_in_type` (String) The type of sign-in used by the identity. The possible values are: emailAddress, userName, federated, or userPrincipalName.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Password Complexity**: Passwords must meet your organization's complexity requirements. Microsoft 365 typically requires a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Required Properties**: The minimum required properties to create a user are `display_name`, `account_enabled`, `user_principal_name`, `mail_nickname`, and `password_profile`.
- **User Principal Name**: The UPN must be unique across your tenant and follow the format `username@domain.com`.
- **Mail Nickname**: This value is used to generate the user's email address if a Microsoft 365 license is assigned.
- **Immutable Properties**: Some properties cannot be changed after creation or are managed by the system.
- **Password Management**: The actual password value is write-only and cannot be read back from the API.
- **Force Password Change**: Use `force_change_password_next_sign_in` to require users to change their password at next login.
- **Identities**: The identities property allows configuring federated authentication methods for the user.
- **External Users**: For guest users, additional properties like `external_user_state` may be relevant.
- **On-Premises Sync**: Properties prefixed with `on_premises_` are typically managed by Azure AD Connect and shouldn't be modified directly.
