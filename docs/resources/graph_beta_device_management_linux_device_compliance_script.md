## Example Usage

```terraform

  display_name = "Linux Security Compliance Check"
  description  = "Checks for critical security configurations on Linux devices"

  detection_script_content = <<-EOT
    #!/bin/bash
    # Detection script for Linux security compliance
    
    # Check if firewall is active
    if ! systemctl is-active --quiet ufw && ! systemctl is-active --quiet firewalld; then
      echo "No firewall service is active - Non-compliant"
      exit 1
    fi
    
    # Check for automatic updates
    if command -v unattended-upgrade >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      if [ ! -f /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades ]; then

        exit 1
      fi
    elif command -v dnf >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      if ! systemctl is-enabled --quiet dnf-automatic.timer; then
        echo "Automatic updates not enabled - Non-compliant"
        exit 1
      fi
    fi

    elif command -v rpm >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      if ! rpm -q fail2ban >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "fail2ban not installed - Non-compliant"
        exit 1

## Schema

### Required

- `detection_script_content` (String) The entire content of the detection shell script for Linux compliance checking.
- `display_name` (String) Name of the Linux device compliance script.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Maximum length is 1500 characters.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the Linux device compliance script.
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The timestamp of when the Linux device compliance script was modified. This property is read-only.
- `setting_definition_id` (String) The setting definition ID for Linux custom compliance discovery script.
- `version` (Number) Version of the Linux device compliance script.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
