# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_reuseable_policy_setting (Resource)

Manages a Reuseable Settings Policy using Settings Catalog in Microsoft Intune for Endpoint Privilege Management.Endpoint Privilege Management supports using reusable settings groups to manage the certificates in place of adding that certificatedirectly to an elevation rule. Like all reusable settings groups for Intune, configurations and changes made to a reusable settingsgroup are automatically passed to the policies that reference the group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Example: Reuseable Policy Setting Resource

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_reuseable_policy_setting" "example" {
  display_name = "epm certificate"
  description  = "Endpoint Privilege Management supports using reusable settings groups to manage the certificates in place of adding that certificate directly to an elevation rule"
  settings = jsonencode({
    "settings" : [
      {
        "id" : "0",
        "settingInstance" : {
          "@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance",
          "settingDefinitionId" : "device_vendor_msft_policy_privilegemanagement_reusablesettings_certificatefile",
          "simpleSettingValue" : {
            "@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue",
            "value" : "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\nMIIDXzCCAkegAwIBAgtcpH\r\nWD9f\r\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })

  # Timeouts configuration (optional)
  timeouts = {
    create = "180s"
    read   = "180s"
    update = "180s"
    delete = "180s"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The reusable setting display name supplied by user.
- `settings` (String) Reuseable Settings Policy with settings catalog settings defined as a valid JSON string. Provide JSON-encoded settings structure. This can either be extracted from an existing policy using the Intune gui export to JSON, via a script such as [this PowerShell script](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-microsoft365/blob/main/scripts/ExportReuseablePolicySettingsById.ps1) or created from scratch. The JSON structure should match the graph schema of the settings catalog. Please look at the terraform documentation for the settings catalog for examples and how to correctly format the HCL.

A correctly formatted field in the HCL should begin and end like this:
```hcl
settings = jsonencode({
  "settings": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "settingInstance": {
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

Note: When setting secret values (identified by `@odata.type: "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSecretSettingValue"`), ensure the `valueState` is set to `"notEncrypted"`. The value `"encryptedValueToken"` is reserved for server responses and should not be used when creating or updating settings.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Reuseable Settings Policy description
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) Creation date and time of the settings catalog policy
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this Reuseable Settings Policy
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) Last modification date and time of the settings catalog policy
- `referencing_configuration_policies` (List of String) List of configuration policies referencing this reuseable policy
- `referencing_configuration_policy_count` (Number) Number of configuration policies referencing this reuseable policy
- `version` (Number) Version of the policy

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Using the provider-default project ID, the import ID is:
# {resource_id}
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_reuseable_policy_settings.example epm-reuseable-policy-id
```
