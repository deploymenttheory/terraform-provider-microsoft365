## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The setting name displayed in the user interface.

### Optional

- `local_admin_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the local admin option is enabled. The default value is `false`. To enable the local admin option, change the setting to `true`. If the local admin option is enabled, the end user can be an admin of the Cloud PC device.
- `reset_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether an end user is allowed to reset their Cloud PC. When `true`, the user is allowed to reset their Cloud PC. When `false`, end-user initiated reset is not allowed. The default value is `false`.
- `restore_point_setting` (Attributes) Defines how frequently a restore point is created (that is, a snapshot is taken) for users' provisioned Cloud PCs (default is 12 hours), and whether the user is allowed to restore their own Cloud PCs to a backup made at a specific point in time. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--restore_point_setting))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The date and time when the setting was created. The timestamp type represents the date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the Cloud PC user setting. Read-only.
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The date and time when the setting was last modified. The timestamp type represents the date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only.

### Nested Schema for `restore_point_setting`

Optional:

- `frequency_type` (String) The time interval in hours to take snapshots (restore points) of a Cloud PC automatically. Possible values are: `default`, `fourHours`, `sixHours`, `twelveHours`, `sixteenHours`, `twentyFourHours`, `unknownFutureValue`. The default value is `default` which indicates that the time interval for automatic capturing of restore point snapshots is set to 12 hours.
- `user_restore_enabled` (Boolean) If `true`, the user has the ability to use snapshots to restore Cloud PCs. If `false`, non-admin users can't use snapshots to restore the Cloud PC.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Windows 365 Cloud PC**: This resource manages user-specific settings for Windows 365 Cloud PC experiences.
- **User Experience Control**: Defines how users interact with their Cloud PCs, including self-service options.
- **Restore Settings**: Controls whether users can restore their Cloud PCs from previous restore points.
- **Local Admin Rights**: Manages whether users have local administrator privileges on their Cloud PCs.
- **Assignment Required**: User settings must be assigned to Azure AD user groups to take effect.
- **Self-Service Portal**: Controls what actions users can perform through the Windows 365 portal.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Configures automatic backup settings and user access to restore functionality.
- **Priority Handling**: When multiple settings apply to a user, the highest priority setting takes precedence.
