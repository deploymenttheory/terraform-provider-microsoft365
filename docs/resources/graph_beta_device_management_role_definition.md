# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_role_definition (Resource)

Manages custom role definitions in Microsoft Intune using the `/deviceManagement/roleDefinitions` endpoint. Role definitions define sets of permissions that can be assigned to administrators, enabling granular access control for device management, policy configuration, and administrative functions within Intune.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_role_definition" "example" {
  display_name                = "android intune"
  description                 = "Custom role for Intune device administration with limited permissions"
  is_built_in_role_definition = false

  # Scope tags for the role definition
  role_scope_tag_ids = ["9", "8"]

  role_permissions = [
    {
      allowed_resource_actions = [
        "Microsoft.Intune_MicrosoftStoreForBusiness_Read",
        "Microsoft.Intune_AndroidSync_Read",

## Schema

### Required

- `is_built_in_role_definition` (Boolean) Type of Role. Set to True if it is built-in, or set to False if it is a custom role definition.

### Optional

- `built_in_role_name` (String) Friendly name of built-in Intune role definitions. Define this if you want to assign one to a security group scope.
- `description` (String) Description of the Role definition.
- `display_name` (String) Display Name of the Role definition.
- `is_built_in` (Boolean) Type of Role. Set to True if it is built-in, or set to False if it is a custom role definition.
- `role_permissions` (Attributes List) List of Role Permissions this role is allowed to perform. Not used for in-built Intune role definitions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--role_permissions))
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Settings Catalog template profile.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Key of the entity. This is read-only and automatically generated.

<a id="nestedatt--role_permissions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `role_permissions`

Optional:

- `allowed_resource_actions` (Set of String) Allowed actions for this role permission. This field is equivalent to 'actions' and can be used interchangeably. The API will consolidate values from both fields.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Role-Based Access Control**: This resource defines custom roles for Microsoft Intune role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Granular Permissions**: Allows creation of roles with specific permissions tailored to organizational needs.
- **Built-in vs Custom**: Custom role definitions supplement built-in Intune roles with organization-specific requirements.
- **Resource Actions**: Role definitions specify which actions can be performed on specific Intune resources.
- **Assignment Support**: Custom roles can be assigned to users and groups through role assignments.
- **Scope Management**: Works with scope tags to limit the scope of permissions within the organization.
- **Security Principle**: Follow the principle of least privilege when creating custom role definitions.
- **Permission Categories**: Permissions are organized by resource types like devices, apps, policies, and configuration.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
