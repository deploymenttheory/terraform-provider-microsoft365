## Schema

### Required

- `is_built_in_role_definition` (Boolean) Type of Role. Set to True if it is built-in, or set to False if it is a custom role definition.

### Optional

- `built_in_role_name` (String) Friendly name of built-in Intune role definitions. Define this if you want to assign one to a security group scope.
- `description` (String) Description of the Role definition.
- `display_name` (String) Display Name of the Role definition.
- `is_built_in` (Boolean) Type of Role. Set to True if it is built-in, or set to False if it is a custom role definition.
- `role_permissions` (Attributes List) List of Role Permissions this role is allowed to perform. Not used for in-built Intune role definitions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--role_permissions))
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) List of Scope Tags to assign to this intune role definition.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Key of the entity. This is read-only and automatically generated.

<a id="nestedatt--role_permissions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `role_permissions`

Optional:

- `allowed_resource_actions` (Set of String) Allowed actions for this role permission. This field is equivalent to 'actions' and can be used interchangeably. The API will consolidate values from both fields.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
