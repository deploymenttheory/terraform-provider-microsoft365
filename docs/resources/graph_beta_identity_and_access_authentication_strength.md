## Schema

### Required

- `allowed_combinations` (Set of String) he authentication method combinations allowed by this authentication strength policy. The possible values of this are: password, voice, hardwareOath, softwareOath, sms, fido2, windowsHelloForBusiness, microsoftAuthenticatorPush, deviceBasedPush, temporaryAccessPassOneTime, temporaryAccessPassMultiUse, email, x509CertificateSingleFactor, x509CertificateMultiFactor, federatedSingleFactor, federatedMultiFactor, unknownFutureValue, qrCodePin.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the authentication strength policy.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the authentication strength policy.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The creation date and time of the authentication strength policy.
- `id` (String) String (identifier)
- `modified_date_time` (String) The last modified date and time of the authentication strength policy.
- `policy_type` (String) Indicates whether this is a Microsoft-managed or customer-created policy.
- `requirements_satisfied` (String) Describes the type of authentication method target that this authentication strength satisfies.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes
A collection of settings that define specific combinations of authentication methods and metadata. The authentication strength policy, when applied to a given scenario using Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, defines which authentication methods must be used to authenticate in that scenario. An authentication strength may be built-in or custom (defined by the tenant) and may or may not fulfill the requirements to grant an MFA claim.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Import using composite ID format: {id}
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_identity_and_access_authentication_strength.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
