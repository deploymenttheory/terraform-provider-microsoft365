## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example of creating a basic role scope tag with a group assignment
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_role_scope_tag" "helpdesk" {
  display_name = "Helpdesk Support Tag"
  description  = "Role scope tag for helpdesk support staff"

  assignments = ["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"]

  timeouts = {
    create = "180s"
    read   = "180s"
    update = "180s"
    delete = "180s"
  }
}

# Example of creating multiple related role scope tags with assignments
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_role_scope_tag" "it_support" {
  display_name = "IT Support Tag"
  description  = "Role scope tag for IT support teams"

  assignments = ["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002"]
}

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_role_scope_tag" "device_management" {
  display_name = "Device Management Tag"
  description  = "Role scope tag for device management teams"

  assignments = [
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003",
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004"
  ]

  timeouts = {

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display or friendly name of the Role Scope Tag.

### Optional

- `assignments` (Set of String) The list of group assignments for the Intune Role Scope Tag.
- `description` (String) Description of the Role Scope Tag.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Key of the entity. This is read-only and automatically generated.
- `is_built_in` (Boolean) Description of the Role Scope Tag. This property is read-only.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **Scope Management**: This resource creates scope tags to limit the scope of administrative permissions in Microsoft Intune.
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Scope tags enable delegation of management to different departments or geographic regions.
- **Resource Isolation**: Objects tagged with scope tags are only visible to administrators with matching scope permissions.
- **Assignment Integration**: Scope tags work with role assignments to define what resources administrators can manage.
- **Default Scope**: All objects are created with the "Default" scope tag unless explicitly assigned different tags.
- **Inheritance**: Some objects inherit scope tags from their parent objects (e.g., apps inherit from app categories).
- **Permission Boundaries**: Administrators can only manage objects that have scope tags matching their assigned permissions.
- **Organizational Structure**: Use scope tags to mirror your organizational structure and delegation requirements.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# {resource_id}
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_role_scope_tag.example role-scope-tag-id
```
