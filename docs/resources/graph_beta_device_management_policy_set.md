# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_policy_set (Resource)

Manages policy sets in Microsoft Intune using the `/deviceAppManagement/policySets` endpoint. Policy sets allow you to group multiple device management policies and applications together for unified deployment and assignment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Policy Set with multiple policy types
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_policy_set" "example" {
  display_name = "example intune policy set"
  description  = "maximal example"

  # Mobile App Policy Set Items
  items = [

- `description` (String) The optional description of the policy set
- `items` (Attributes Set) Set of policy set items ('apps', 'app configuration policies', 'app protection policies', 'device configuration profiles', 'device management configuration policies', 'device compliance policies', 'windows autopilot deployment profiles') included in this policy set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this policy set.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) The date and time the policy set was created
- `error_code` (String) The error code for the policy set (e.g., noError)
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this policy set
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) The date and time the policy set was last modified
- `status` (String) The status of the policy set (e.g., notAssigned, assigned)

<a id="nestedatt--assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of assignment target. Must be one of: 'allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget', 'groupAssignmentTarget'.

- `type` (String) The type of policy set item. Valid values: 'app', 'app_configuration_policy', 'app_protection_policy', 'device_configuration_profile', 'device_management_configuration_policy', 'device_compliance_policy', 'windows_autopilot_deployment_profile'

Optional:

- `intent` (String) The intent for mobile app policy set items (e.g., required, available)
- `settings` (Attributes) Settings specific to the policy set item type (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--settings))
