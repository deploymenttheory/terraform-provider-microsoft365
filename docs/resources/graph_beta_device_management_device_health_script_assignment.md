## Schema

### Required

- `target` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--target))

### Optional

- `run_remediation_script` (Boolean) Indicates whether remediation script should be run. Default is false.
- `run_schedule` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--run_schedule))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the device health script assignment.

<a id="nestedatt--target"></a>
### Nested Schema for `target`

Required:

- `target_type` (String) The target group type for the script assignment. Possible values are:

- **allDevices**: Target all devices in the tenant
- **allLicensedUsers**: Target all licensed users in the tenant
- **configurationManagerCollection**: Target System Center Configuration Manager collection
- **exclusionGroupAssignment**: Target a specific Entra ID group for exclusion
- **groupAssignment**: Target a specific Entra ID group

Optional:

- `collection_id` (String) The SCCM group collection ID for the assignment target. Default collections start with 'SMS', while custom collections start with your site code (e.g., 'MEM').

- `device_and_app_management_assignment_filter_type` (String) The type of scope filter for the target assignment. Defaults to 'none'. Possible values are:

- **include**: Only include devices or users matching the filter
- **exclude**: Exclude devices or users matching the filter
- **none**: No assignment filter applied
