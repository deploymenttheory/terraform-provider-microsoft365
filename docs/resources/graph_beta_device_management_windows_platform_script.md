## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) Name of the windows platform script.
- `file_name` (String) Script file name.
- `run_as_account` (String) Indicates the type of execution context. Possible values are: `system`, `user`.
- `script_content` (String, Sensitive) The script content.

### Optional

- `assignments` (Attributes) The assignment configuration for this Windows Settings Catalog profile. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assignments))
- `description` (String) Optional description for the windows platform script.
- `enforce_signature_check` (Boolean) Indicate whether the script signature needs be checked.
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Settings Catalog template profile.
- `run_as_32_bit` (Boolean) A value indicating whether the PowerShell script should run as 32-bit.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this Intune windows platform script

<a id="nestedatt--assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Optional:

- `all_devices` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all devices. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all devices in the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users` and `exclude_group_ids`.
- `all_users` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all users. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all licensed users within the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices` and `exclude_group_ids`.
- `exclude_group_ids` (Set of String) A set of group IDs to exclude from the assignment. These groups will not receive the assignment, even if they match other inclusion criteria.
- `include_group_ids` (Set of String) A set of entra id group Id's to include in the assignment.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".

## Important Notes

- **PowerShell Scripts**: This resource manages PowerShell scripts for Windows devices in Microsoft Intune.
- **Script Execution**: Scripts are executed on Windows devices using the Intune Management Extension.
- **User vs System Context**: Scripts can run in user context or system context depending on configuration.
- **Assignment Required**: Scripts must be assigned to device or user groups to be deployed.
- **Script Validation**: Intune validates script syntax and provides execution status reporting.
- **Return Codes**: Scripts can return success/failure codes that are reported back to Intune.
- **Security Context**: Scripts running in system context have elevated privileges and should be carefully reviewed.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Script content is typically base64 encoded for transmission and storage.
- **Execution Frequency**: Scripts can be configured to run once or repeatedly based on detection rules.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
