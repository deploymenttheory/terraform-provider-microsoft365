  display_name       = "Example Device Management Script"
  description        = "This is an example device management script"
  role_scope_tag_ids = ["0"]

  # The actual script content (should be PowerShell script content only)
  script_content = <<EOT
    # Your PowerShell script here
    Write-Host "Hello from device management script!"

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) Name of the windows platform script.
- `file_name` (String) Script file name.
- `run_as_account` (String) Indicates the type of execution context. Possible values are: `system`, `user`.
- `script_content` (String, Sensitive) The script content.

### Optional

- `assignments` (Attributes Set) Assignments for the Windows remediation script. Each assignment specifies the target group and schedule for script execution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assignments))
- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Maximum length is 1500 characters.
- `enforce_signature_check` (Boolean) Indicate whether the script signature needs be checked.
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Settings Catalog template profile.
- `run_as_32_bit` (Boolean) A value indicating whether the PowerShell script should run as 32-bit.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this Intune windows platform script

<a id="nestedatt--assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of assignment target. Must be one of: 'allDevicesAssignmentTarget', 'allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget', 'groupAssignmentTarget', 'exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget'.

Optional:

- `group_id` (String) The Entra ID group ID to include or exclude in the assignment. Required when type is 'groupAssignmentTarget' or 'exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget'.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **PowerShell Scripts**: This resource manages PowerShell scripts for Windows devices in Microsoft Intune.
- **Script Execution**: Scripts are executed on Windows devices using the Intune Management Extension.
- **User vs System Context**: Scripts can run in user context or system context depending on configuration.
- **Assignment Required**: Scripts must be assigned to device or user groups to be deployed.
- **Script Validation**: Intune validates script syntax and provides execution status reporting.
- **Return Codes**: Scripts can return success/failure codes that are reported back to Intune.
- **Security Context**: Scripts running in system context have elevated privileges and should be carefully reviewed.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Script content is typically base64 encoded for transmission and storage.
- **Execution Frequency**: Scripts can be configured to run once or repeatedly based on detection rules.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# {resource_id}
