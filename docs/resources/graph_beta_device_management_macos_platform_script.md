## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) Name of the macOS Platform Script.
- `file_name` (String) Script file name.
- `run_as_account` (String) Indicates the type of execution context. Possible values are: `system`, `user`.
- `script_content` (String, Sensitive) The script content.

### Optional

- `assignments` (Attributes) The assignment configuration for this Windows Settings Catalog profile. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assignments))
- `block_execution_notifications` (Boolean) Does not notify the user a script is being executed.
- `description` (String) Optional description for the macOS Platform Script.
- `execution_frequency` (String) The interval for script to run in ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., PT1H for 1 hour, P1D for 1 day). If not defined the script will run once.
- `retry_count` (Number) Number of times for the script to be retried if it fails.
- `role_scope_tag_ids` (Set of String) Set of scope tag IDs for this Settings Catalog template profile.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the macOS platform script.

### Nested Schema for `assignments`

Optional:

- `all_devices` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all devices. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all devices in the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_users` and `exclude_group_ids`.
- `all_users` (Boolean) Specifies whether this assignment applies to all users. When set to `true`, the assignment targets all licensed users within the organization.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices`.Can be used as an alternative to `include_groups`.Can be used in conjuction with `all_devices` and `exclude_group_ids`.
- `exclude_group_ids` (Set of String) A set of group IDs to exclude from the assignment. These groups will not receive the assignment, even if they match other inclusion criteria.
- `include_group_ids` (Set of String) A set of entra id group Id's to include in the assignment.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Important Notes

- **macOS Shell Scripts**: This resource manages shell scripts for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune using the deviceShellScript API.
- **Script Execution**: Scripts are executed on macOS devices using the Intune management agent (Microsoft Intune Agent.app).
- **User vs Root Context**: Scripts can run as the current user or with root privileges depending on configuration.
- **Assignment Required**: Scripts must be assigned to device or user groups to be deployed.
- **Script Validation**: Intune provides execution status reporting and logs for troubleshooting.
- **Return Codes**: Scripts should use appropriate exit codes to indicate success or failure.
- **Security Context**: Scripts running with root privileges should be carefully reviewed for security implications.
- **File Size Limits**: Script files must be less than 1 MB in size.
- **Execution Frequency**: Scripts can be configured to run once or repeatedly based on schedule settings.
- **Platform Support**: Supports macOS 12.0 and later versions with Intune management agent installed.
- **Shebang Requirement**: Scripts must begin with a proper shebang (#!/bin/sh, #!/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/env zsh).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
