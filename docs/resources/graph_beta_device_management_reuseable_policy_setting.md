# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_reuseable_policy_setting (Resource)

Manages reusable policy settings using the `/deviceManagement/reusablePolicySettings` endpoint. Reusable settings enable centralized management of configuration templates that can be referenced across multiple policies, reducing duplication and ensuring consistent settings application across Endpoint Privilege Management and other device configuration policies.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Example: Reuseable Policy Setting Resource

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_reuseable_policy_setting" "example" {
  display_name = "epm certificate"
  description  = "Endpoint Privilege Management supports using reusable settings groups to manage the certificates in place of adding that certificate directly to an elevation rule"
  settings = jsonencode({
    "settings" : [
      {
        "id" : "0",
        "settingInstance" : {
          "@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance",
          "settingDefinitionId" : "device_vendor_msft_policy_privilegemanagement_reusablesettings_certificatefile",
          "simpleSettingValue" : {
            "@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue",
            "value" : "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\nMIIDXzCCAkegAwIBAgtcpH\r\nWD9f\r\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The reusable setting display name supplied by user.
- `settings` (String) Reuseable Settings Policy with settings catalog settings defined as a valid JSON string. Please provide a valid JSON-encoded settings structure. This can either be extracted from an existing policy using the Intune gui `export JSON` functionality if supported, via a script such as this powershell script. [ExportReuseablePolicySettingsById](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-microsoft365/blob/main/scripts/Export-IntuneReuseablePolicySettingsById.ps1) or created from scratch. The JSON structure should match the graph schema of the settings catalog. Please look at the terraform documentation for the settings catalog template for examples and how to correctly format the HCL.

A correctly formatted field in the HCL should begin and end like this:
```hcl
settings = jsonencode({
  "settings": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "settingInstance": {
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

**Note:** Settings must always be provided as an array within the settings field, even when configuring a single setting.This is required because the Microsoft Graph SDK for Go always returns settings in an array format

**Note:** When configuring secret values (identified by @odata.type: "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSecretSettingValue") ensure the valueState is set to "notEncrypted". The value "encryptedValueToken" is reserved for serverresponses and should not be used when creating or updating settings.

```hcl
settings = jsonencode({
  "settings": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "settingInstance": {
        "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance",
        "settingDefinitionId": "com.apple.loginwindow_autologinpassword",
        "settingInstanceTemplateReference": null,
        "simpleSettingValue": {
          "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSecretSettingValue",
          "valueState": "notEncrypted",
          "value": "your_secret_value",
          "settingValueTemplateReference": null
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

### Optional

- `description` (String) Reuseable Settings Policy description
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_date_time` (String) Creation date and time of the settings catalog policy
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this Reuseable Settings Policy
- `last_modified_date_time` (String) Last modification date and time of the settings catalog policy
- `referencing_configuration_policies` (List of String) List of configuration policies referencing this reuseable policy
- `referencing_configuration_policy_count` (Number) Number of configuration policies referencing this reuseable policy
- `version` (Number) Version of the policy

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
