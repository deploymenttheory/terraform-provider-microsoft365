# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_mobile_app_supersedence (Resource)

Manages mobile app supersedence relationships in Microsoft Intune using the /deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/{mobileAppId}/relationships endpoint. Supersedence enables admins to upgrade or replace existing apps with newer versions in a controlled manner.

## Microsoft Documentation

## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.14.1-alpha | Experimental | Initial release |

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example demonstrates how to create a supersedence relationship between two mobile apps in Intune
# The supersedence relationship allows you to upgrade or replace an older app with a newer version

# Example 1: Create an "update" supersedence relationship between two apps
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_mobile_app_supersedence" "update_example" {
  source_id         = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" # ID of the older app version
  target_id         = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002" # ID of the newer app version
  supersedence_type = "update"                               # Indicates this is an update to the existing app

  # Optional timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "10m"
    read   = "5m"
    update = "10m"
    delete = "5m"
  }
}

# Example 2: Create a "replace" supersedence relationship between two apps
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_and_app_management_mobile_app_supersedence" "replace_example" {
  source_id         = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003" # ID of the app being replaced
  target_id         = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004" # ID of the replacement app
  supersedence_type = "replace"                              # Indicates this app replaces the source app
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `source_id` (String) The unique app identifier of the source of the mobile app relationship entity. For example: 2dbc75b9-e993-4e4d-a071-91ac5a218672. If null during relationship creation, then it will be populated with parent Id. Read-Only.
- `supersedence_type` (String) The supersedence relationship type between the parent and child apps. Possible values are: update, replace.
- `target_id` (String) The unique app identifier of the target of the mobile app relationship entity. For example: 2dbc75b9-e993-4e4d-a071-91ac5a218672.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `app_relationship_type` (String) The type of relationship indicating whether the target application of a relationship is a parent or child in the relationship. Possible values are: parent, child. Read-Only.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the mobile app relationship entity. This is assigned at MobileAppRelationship entity creation. For example: 2dbc75b9-e993-4e4d-a071-91ac5a218672_43aaaf35-ce51-4695-9447-5eac6df31161. Read-Only.
- `source_display_name` (String) The display name of the app that is the source of the mobile app relationship entity. For example: Orca. Maximum length is 500 characters. Read-Only.
- `source_display_version` (String) The display version of the app that is the source of the mobile app relationship entity. For example 1.0.12 or 1.2203.156 or 3. Read-Only.
- `source_publisher_display_name` (String) The publisher display name of the app that is the source of the mobile app relationship entity. For example: Fabrikam. Maximum length is 500 characters. Read-Only.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
