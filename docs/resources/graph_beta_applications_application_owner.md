# microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application_owner (Resource)

Manages an owner assignment for a Microsoft Entra Application using the `/applications/{id}/owners` endpoint. Owners are users or service principals who are allowed to modify the application object. As a recommended best practice, applications should have at least two owners.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Graph API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-post-owners?view=graph-rest-beta).

## Microsoft Documentation

- [application: List owners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-list-owners?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http)
- [application: Add owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-post-owners?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http)
- [application: Remove owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-delete-owners?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http)

## Microsoft Graph API Permissions

The following client `application` permissions are needed in order to use this resource:

**Required:**
- `Application.Read.All`
- `Directory.Read.All`
- `Application.ReadWrite.All`
- `Directory.ReadWrite.All`

**Optional:**
- `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` (if managing only applications owned by the service principal)
- `User.Read.All` (when assigning user owners)
- `Application.Read.All` (when assigning service principal owners)

Find out more about the permissions required for managing applications at Microsoft Learn [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-beta).

## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.43.0 | Experimental | Initial release |

## Important Notes

- **Owner Types**: Owners can be either Users or Service Principals
- **Minimum One Owner**: Applications must have at least one owner
- **Owner Object Type**: The `owner_object_type` attribute must be set correctly based on the owner type being assigned
- **Permissions**: Ensure the service principal has permissions to read both users and service principals when assigning owners

## Example Usage

### User as Application Owner

```terraform
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application" "example" {
  display_name = "my-application"
  description  = "Application with user owner"
}

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_users_user" "app_owner" {
  display_name        = "Application Owner"
  user_principal_name = "app.owner@mycompany.com"
  mail_nickname       = "app.owner"
  account_enabled     = true
  password_profile = {
    password                           = "TempP@ssw0rd123!"
    force_change_password_next_sign_in = true
  }
}

# Assign user as application owner
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application_owner" "user_owner" {
  application_id    = microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application.example.id
  owner_id          = microsoft365_graph_beta_users_user.app_owner.id
  owner_object_type = "User"
}
```

### Service Principal as Application Owner

```terraform
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application" "managed_app" {
  display_name = "my-managed-application"
  description  = "Application managed by a service principal"
}

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application" "manager_app" {
  display_name = "app-manager"
  description  = "Service principal that manages other applications"
}

resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "manager_sp" {
  app_id = microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application.manager_app.app_id
}

# Assign service principal as application owner
resource "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application_owner" "sp_owner" {
  application_id    = microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application.managed_app.id
  owner_id          = microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal.manager_sp.id
  owner_object_type = "ServicePrincipal"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `application_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) for the application.
- `owner_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) for the owner to be added to the application. This can be a user or service principal.
- `owner_object_type` (String) The type of object being added as an owner. This determines the correct Microsoft Graph API endpoint to use. Valid values: 'User', 'ServicePrincipal'.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this application owner assignment. This is a composite ID formed by combining the application ID and owner ID.
- `owner_display_name` (String) The display name of the owner. Read-only.
- `owner_type` (String) The type of the owner object as returned by Microsoft Graph (e.g., 'User', 'ServicePrincipal'). Read-only.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

```shell
# Import an application owner by composite ID: application_id/owner_id
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_application_owner.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
