## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display or friendly name of the role assignment.
- `scope_type` (String) Administrators in this role assignment can target policies, applications and remote tasks to a scope type of:'allDevices', 'allLicensedUsers', 'allDevicesAndLicensedUsers' and 'resourceScope'. If the scope intent is for a Entra ID group then leave this empty. Possible values are: `allDevices`, `allLicensedUsers`, `allDevicesAndLicensedUsers`, `resourceScope`.

### Optional

- `built_in_role_name` (String) The name of the built-in role to assign. Either this or `role_definition_id` must be specified.
- `description` (String) Description of the role assignment.
- `resource_scopes` (Set of String) Administrators in this role assignment can target policies, applications and remote tasks. List of IDs of role scope member security groups from Entra ID.
- `role_definition_id` (String) The ID of the role definition to assign. Either this or `built_in_role_name` must be specified.
- `scope_members` (Set of String) Group IDs that are assigned as members of this role scope. Also known as admin_group_users_group_ids in the API.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Key of the Role Assignment. This is read-only and automatically generated.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
