## Important Notes

- **Windows Update Rings**: This resource manages Windows Update for Business configuration policies, allowing you to control how and when Windows updates are applied to managed devices.
- **Active Hours**: The active hours configuration (start and end time) defines when devices should not automatically restart after updates. Both values must be provided together.
- **Update Deferrals**: Quality updates can be deferred up to 30 days, and feature updates can be deferred up to 30 days.
- **Windows 11 Upgrade**: The `allow_windows11_upgrade` attribute controls whether eligible Windows 10 devices can upgrade to Windows 11.
- **Automatic Update Mode**: Controls how updates are installed and when restarts occur. Options range from notification-only to fully automated installation and restart.
- **Delivery Optimization**: Controls how updates are downloaded and distributed within your network to optimize bandwidth usage.
