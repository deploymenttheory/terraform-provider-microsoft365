- **Content Upload**: The resource handles uploading the app content to Intune for distribution.
- **Assignment Required**: Apps must be assigned to user or device groups to be deployed through Intune.
- **Detection Rules**: Configure detection rules to determine if the app is successfully installed on target devices.
- **Installation Context**: LOB apps can be installed in user or device context depending on configuration.
