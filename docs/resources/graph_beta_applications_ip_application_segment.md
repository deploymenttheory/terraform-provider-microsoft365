## Schema

### Required

- `application_id` (String) The unique object identifier of the application.
- `destination_host` (String) Either the IP address, IP range, or FQDN of the application segment, with or without wildcards.
- `destination_type` (String) The type of destination for the application segment.The possible values are: `ipAddress`, `ipRange`, `ipRangeCidr`, `fqdn`, `dnsSuffix`, `unknownFutureValue`.
- `ports` (Set of String) List of ports supported for the application segment.
- `protocol` (String) Indicates the protocol of the network traffic acquired for the application segment.The possible values are: `tcp`, `udp`, `unknownFutureValue`.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the application segment.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import an existing IP application segment by its ID
terraform import microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_ip_application_segment.example_ip_address "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

# The ID format is the segment's unique identifier (GUID)
# You can find the segment ID in the Azure Portal or via Microsoft Graph API:
# GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/{application-id}/onPremisesPublishing/segmentsConfiguration/microsoft.graph.ipSegmentConfiguration/applicationSegments
```
