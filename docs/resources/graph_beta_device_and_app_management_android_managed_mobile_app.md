## Schema

### Required

- `managed_app_protection_id` (String) The ID of the Android managed app protection policy to associate this app with
- `mobile_app_identifier` (Attributes) The Android app identifier information (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--mobile_app_identifier))

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `version` (String) The version of the managed mobile app

### Read-Only

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
