# microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal (Data Source)

Retrieves service principals from Microsoft Entra ID using the `/servicePrincipals` endpoint. This data source is used to query enterprise applications and managed identities with advanced filtering capabilities.

## Microsoft Documentation

- [servicePrincipal resource type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta)

## Microsoft Graph API Permissions

The following client `application` permissions are needed in order to use this data source:

**Required:**
- `Application.Read.All`
- `Application.ReadWrite.All`
- `Directory.Read.All`
- `Directory.ReadWrite.All`

**Optional:**
- `None` `[N/A]`

## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v0.31.0-alpha | Experimental | Initial release |

## Important Notes
This method supports the $select and $expand OData query parameters to help customize the response.

This method supports the $count, $expand, $filter, $orderby, $search, $select, and $top OData query parameters to help customize the response. Some queries are supported only when you use the ConsistencyLevel header set to eventual and $count. For more information, see Advanced query capabilities on directory objects.

By default, this API doesn't return the public key value of the key in the keyCredentials property unless keyCredentials is specified in a $select query. For example, $select=id,appId,keyCredentials.

The use of $select to get keyCredentials for service principals has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Return all service principals
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "all" {
  filter_type = "all"
}

# Return a service principal by display name
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "by_display_name" {
  filter_type  = "display_name"
  filter_value = "Microsoft Graph"
}

# Return a service principal by app id
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "by_app_id" {
  filter_type  = "app_id"
  filter_value = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" // Microsoft Graph PowerShell
}

# Return a service principal by odata filter
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "odata_advanced" {
  filter_type  = "odata"
  odata_filter = "startsWith(displayName,'Microsoft')"
  odata_select = "id,appId,displayName,publisherName"
  odata_top    = 10
  odata_skip   = 0
}

# Return a service principal by odata filter with comprehensive options
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "odata_comprehensive" {
  filter_type   = "odata"
  odata_filter  = "startsWith(displayName,'Microsoft')"
  odata_count   = true
  odata_orderby = "displayName"
  odata_search  = "\"displayName:Graph\""
  odata_select  = "id,appId,displayName,publisherName,servicePrincipalType"
  odata_top     = 5
  odata_skip    = 0
}

# Return a service principal by odata filter with matching display name
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_applications_service_principal" "odata_matching_display_name" {
  filter_type  = "odata"
  odata_search = "\"displayName:Intune\""
  odata_count  = true
}
```
