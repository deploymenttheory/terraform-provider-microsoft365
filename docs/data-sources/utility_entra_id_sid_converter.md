# microsoft365_utility_entra_id_sid_converter

Converts between Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) Security Identifiers (SIDs) and Object IDs.

This utility performs bidirectional conversion - provide either a SID to get an Object ID, or an Object ID to get a SID. 
This is particularly useful for hybrid environments where on-premises Active Directory identities are synced to Entra ID,
and you need to correlate SIDs from on-premises systems with Object IDs in the cloud.

## Background

When on-premises Active Directory users, groups, or devices are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), 
they receive both a Security Identifier (SID) from the on-premises directory and an Object ID (GUID) in the cloud.
These identifiers are mathematically related through a specific conversion algorithm.

## Schema

### Optional

- `object_id` (String) The Object ID (GUID) in the format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. Provide this to convert to a SID, or leave empty to convert from a SID.
- `sid` (String) The Security Identifier (SID) in the format `S-1-12-1-<rid1>-<rid2>-<rid3>-<rid4>`. Provide this to convert to an Object ID, or leave empty to convert from an Object ID. Each RID component must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295).
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
