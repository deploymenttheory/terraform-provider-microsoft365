# microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan (Data Source)

Retrieves Cloud PC Frontline Service Plans from Microsoft Intune using the `/deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/frontlineServicePlans` endpoint. Supports filtering by all, id, or display_name for service plan discovery and management.

Frontline service plans provide an allotment of three Cloud PCs for the admin to provision for up to three users, but can't be assigned to a specific user. This service plan enables the service to create a concept of a time-share across these provisioned users, where customers can deploy a larger number of users.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Retrieve all Cloud PC Frontline Service Plans
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan" "all" {
  filter_type = "all"
}

# Output: List all frontline service plans with all fields
output "all_frontline_service_plans" {
  value = [for plan in data.microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan.all.items : {
    id           = plan.id
    display_name = plan.display_name
    total_count  = plan.total_count
    used_count   = plan.used_count
  }]
}

# Output: Detailed frontline service plan usage statistics
output "frontline_service_plan_usage" {
  value = {
    for plan in data.microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan.all.items : plan.display_name => {
      total_licenses = plan.total_count
      used_licenses  = plan.used_count
      available_licenses = plan.total_count - plan.used_count
      usage_percentage = plan.total_count > 0 ? (plan.used_count * 100 / plan.total_count) : 0
    }
  }
}


# Example: Retrieve a specific frontline service plan by ID
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan" "by_id" {
  filter_type  = "id"
  filter_value = "057efbfe-a95d-4263-acb0-12b4a31fed8d" # Replace with an actual ID
}

output "frontline_service_plan_by_id" {
  value = data.microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan.by_id.items[0]
}

# Example: Retrieve frontline service plans by display name substring
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan" "by_display_name" {
  filter_type  = "display_name"
  filter_value = "2vCPU" # This will match plans containing "2vCPU" in their name
}

output "frontline_service_plans_by_display_name" {
  value = data.microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan.by_display_name.items
}

# Example: Show usage statistics for all frontline service plans
output "frontline_service_plan_usage" {
  value = [for plan in data.microsoft365_graph_beta_windows_365_cloud_pc_frontline_service_plan.all.items : {
    display_name = plan.display_name
    used_count   = plan.used_count
    total_count  = plan.total_count
    usage_percent = plan.total_count > 0 ? (plan.used_count * 100 / plan.total_count) : 0
  }]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `filter_type` (String) Type of filter to apply. Valid values are: `all`, `id`, `display_name`. Use 'all' to retrieve all frontline service plans, 'id' to retrieve a specific plan by its unique identifier, or 'display_name' to filter by the plan's display name.

### Optional

- `filter_value` (String) Value to filter by. Not required when filter_type is 'all'. For 'id', provide the frontline service plan ID. For 'display_name', provide a substring to match against plan display names.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) The list of Cloud PC frontline service plans that match the filter criteria. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).


<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `display_name` (String) The display name of the frontline service plan. For example, '2vCPU/8GB/128GB Front-line' or '4vCPU/16GB/256GB Front-line'.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the frontline service plan.
- `total_count` (Number) The total number of frontline service plans purchased by the customer.
- `used_count` (Number) The number of service plans that have been used for the account.
