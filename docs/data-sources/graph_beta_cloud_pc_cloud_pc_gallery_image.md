# microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image (Data Source)

Retrieves Cloud PC Gallery Images from Microsoft Intune using the `/deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/galleryImages` endpoint. Supports filtering by all, id, or display_name for image discovery and selection.

Gallery images represent the available OS images that can be used to provision Cloud PCs. This data source allows you to discover available images, their support status, and key details like OS version and size.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Retrieve all Cloud PC Gallery Images

data "microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image" "all" {
  filter_type = "all"
}

# Output: List all gallery image IDs
output "all_gallery_image_ids" {
  value = [for image in data.microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image.all.items : image.id]
}

# Output: Show all details for the first gallery image (if present)
output "first_gallery_image_details" {
  value = data.microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image.all.items[0]
}

# Example: Retrieve a specific gallery image by ID
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image" "by_id" {
  filter_type  = "id"
  filter_value = "MicrosoftWindowsDesktop_windows-ent-cpc_win11-22h2-ent-cpc-m365" # Example ID format
}

output "gallery_image_by_id" {
  value = data.microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image.by_id.items[0]
}

# Example: Retrieve gallery images by display name substring
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image" "by_display_name" {
  filter_type  = "display_name"
  filter_value = "Windows 11" # This will match images containing "Windows 11" in their name
}

output "gallery_images_by_display_name" {
  value = data.microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image.by_display_name.items
}

# Example: Show available Windows 11 images with their status and dates
output "windows_11_images_status" {
  value = [for image in data.microsoft365_graph_beta_cloud_pc_cloud_pc_gallery_image.by_display_name.items : {
    display_name    = image.display_name
    status          = image.status
    start_date      = image.start_date
    end_date        = image.end_date
    expiration_date = image.expiration_date
    size_in_gb      = image.size_in_gb
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `filter_type` (String) Type of filter to apply. Valid values are: `all`, `id`, `display_name`. Use 'all' to retrieve all gallery images, 'id' to retrieve a specific image by its unique identifier, or 'display_name' to filter by the image's display name.

### Optional

- `filter_value` (String) Value to filter by. Not required when filter_type is 'all'. For 'id', provide the gallery image ID. For 'display_name', provide a substring to match against image display names.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) The list of Cloud PC gallery images that match the filter criteria. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
