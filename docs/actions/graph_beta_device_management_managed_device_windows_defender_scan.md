### Best Practices

**Scan Scheduling**
- **Quick Scans**: During business hours (minimal impact)
- **Full Scans**: Off-hours, weekends, overnight
- Avoid scanning during critical business operations
- Consider time zones for global deployments
- Stagger scans to avoid network congestion

**Device Considerations**
- Check device uptime and availability
- Ensure devices are online
- Consider battery status for laptops
- Verify adequate disk space
- Check network bandwidth

**Resource Management**
- Batch devices into manageable groups
- Don't scan entire fleet simultaneously
- Monitor scan progress
- Plan for failed scans (offline devices)
- Set appropriate timeouts

**User Communication**
- Notify users before full scans
- Explain performance impact
- Provide estimated duration
- Advise saving work
- Set expectations

**Threat Response**
- Full scan immediately on threat detection
- Isolate affected devices
- Review scan results
- Follow up with remediation
- Document incidents

### Scan Results and Reporting

**Intune Admin Center**
1. Navigate to Devices → All devices
2. Select device
3. View "Defender Antivirus" section
4. Check "Last scan" timestamp
5. Review "Threats found"
6. Check "Scan status"

**Information Available**
- Last scan date/time
- Scan type (quick/full)
- Scan status (completed/failed/in progress)
- Threats found
- Threats quarantined
- Scan duration
- Definition version

**Time to Complete**
- Command delivery: < 1 minute
- Quick scan: 5-15 minutes
- Full scan: 30+ minutes to hours
- Results reporting: Real-time
- Console update: 5-15 minutes

### Threat Detection and Remediation

**Automatic Actions**
- Malware quarantined immediately
- Threats blocked from executing
- Suspicious files isolated
- Registry changes reverted
- System protected

**Threat Types Detected**
- Viruses and worms
- Trojans and spyware
- Ransomware
- Potentially unwanted applications (PUA)
- Rootkits
- Bootkits
- Exploits
- Backdoors

**Remediation Options**
- Automatic (recommended)
- User confirmation
- Custom actions
- Allow/block lists
- Exclusions

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Scan doesn't start | Device offline | Wait for device to come online |
| Scan fails | Defender disabled | Enable Defender in policy |
| Timeout | Full scan too long | Increase timeout setting |
| No results | Scan in progress | Wait for completion |
| Permission denied | Insufficient rights | Check API permissions |
| Device not found | Invalid device ID | Verify device exists |
| Non-Windows device | Wrong OS | Filter for Windows only |
| Scan cancelled | User intervention | Re-run scan, notify user |

### Limitations

**Technical Limits**
- Windows devices only
- Requires Windows Defender
- Device must be online
- Network connectivity required
- Definitions must be up-to-date

**Operational Limits**
- User can pause/cancel scan
- Performance impact during full scan
- Scan duration varies by device
- Offline devices won't scan
- Battery-powered devices may defer

**Platform Limits**
- Not available on non-Windows platforms
- Requires Windows Defender enabled
- Some devices may have third-party AV
- Co-managed devices require both systems healthy

### Windows Defender Requirements

**Minimum Requirements**
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server
- Windows Defender Antivirus installed
- Windows Defender service running
- Real-time protection can be enabled or disabled
- Definitions can be outdated (updated before scan)

**Policy Requirements**
- Defender not disabled by group policy
- Scan permissions allowed
- Remote actions enabled
- Device enrolled in Intune

**Network Requirements**
- Internet connectivity
- Access to definition updates
- Access to Intune endpoints
- Firewall permits traffic

### Definition Updates

**Before Scan**
- Definitions automatically updated
- Latest signatures downloaded
- Ensures current threat detection
- May add 1-2 minutes to scan time

**Update Sources**
- Microsoft Update
- Windows Update
- WSUS
- Internal distribution
- Direct download

### Co-Management Context

**How Scanning Works**
- This action triggers scan via Intune endpoint
- ConfigMgr can also trigger scans independently
- Both systems can view results
- No conflict between systems
- Workload assignment doesn't affect scan capability

**Best Practices**
- Coordinate with ConfigMgr team
- Avoid duplicate scan scheduling
- Use one system for scan management
- Share scan results between teams
- Document which system manages scans

## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_devices` (Attributes List) List of co-managed Windows devices to scan with individual scan type configuration. These are devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM). Each entry specifies a device ID and scan type.

**Co-Management Context:**
- Devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager
- Typically Windows 10/11 enterprise devices
- This action triggers Defender scan via Intune endpoint
- ConfigMgr can also trigger scans independently

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--comanaged_devices))
- `managed_devices` (Attributes List) List of managed Windows devices to scan with individual scan type configuration. Each entry specifies a device ID and whether to perform a quick scan or full scan. These are devices fully managed by Intune only.

Example:
```hcl
managed_devices = [
  {
    device_id  = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
    quick_scan = true  # Quick scan (5-15 min)
  },
  {
    device_id  = "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"
    quick_scan = false # Full scan (30+ min)
  }
]
```

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--managed_devices))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--comanaged_devices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `comanaged_devices`

Required:

- `device_id` (String) The co-managed device ID (GUID) of the Windows device to scan. Example: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
- `quick_scan` (Boolean) Whether to perform a quick scan (`true`) or full scan (`false`). See managed_devices.quick_scan for detailed explanation of scan types.


<a id="nestedatt--managed_devices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `managed_devices`

Required:

- `device_id` (String) The managed device ID (GUID) of the Windows device to scan. Example: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
- `quick_scan` (Boolean) Whether to perform a quick scan (`true`) or full scan (`false`).

- **Quick Scan (`true`)**: Fast scan of common threat locations (5-15 minutes)
  - Scans system folders, registry, memory, startup locations
  - Minimal impact on device performance
  - Recommended for routine/scheduled scans
  - Good for rapid security checks

- **Full Scan (`false`)**: Comprehensive scan of entire system (30+ minutes to hours)
  - Scans all files, folders, drives, archives
  - Higher impact on device performance
  - Recommended when threat detected
  - Thorough investigation of suspicious activity
  - Post-incident verification


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
