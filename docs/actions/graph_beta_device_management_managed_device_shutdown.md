# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_shutdown (Action)

Remotely shuts down managed devices using the `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/shutDown` endpoint. This action powers off devices completely, which is useful for energy conservation, maintenance operations, or security scenarios. Unlike reboot, shutdown powers the device off completely and requires manual intervention to power it back on.

**Important Notes:**
- Device shuts down completely (powers off)
- Device requires manual power-on to restart
- Any unsaved work on the device will be lost
- Users receive minimal or no warning before shutdown
- Shutdown is forceful and does not wait for user interaction
- Command is queued if device is offline
- Use with extreme caution - device will be completely offline

**Use Cases:**
- Energy conservation during extended non-use periods
- Security incident response (isolate compromised device)
- Hardware maintenance requiring full power-off
- Decommissioning devices before storage or shipment
- Emergency response to prevent data exfiltration
- Scheduled shutdowns for lab or classroom devices
- Reducing power consumption in device fleets
- Preparing devices for physical relocation

**Platform Support:**

- **macOS**: Supported (requires user-approved MDM or supervised)
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Limited support (supervised devices only, rare use case)
- **Android**: Not supported for shutdown action

**Shutdown vs Reboot:**
- **Shutdown**: Device powers off completely, requires manual restart
- **Reboot**: Device automatically restarts, comes back online
- Use shutdown for: Long-term offline, security incidents, energy savings
- Use reboot for: Updates, troubleshooting, configuration changes

**Best Practices:**
- Only use when device needs to remain offline
- Ensure physical access is available to power device back on
- Notify users before shutdown (device will be offline)
- Schedule for end of business day or weekends
- Document reason for shutdown in change management
- Verify device location before shutdown (ensure accessibility)
- Consider reboot instead if device needs to come back online
- Test with small groups before bulk operations

**User Impact:**
- Users lose all unsaved work
- Device becomes completely unavailable
- Active sessions are terminated
- Physical access required to power device back on
- May cause significant disruption to user productivity
- Users cannot access device remotely after shutdown

| **Reboot** | Restarts | Automatic (2-5 min) | Updates, troubleshooting, config changes |

### Common Use Cases

- Energy conservation (weekends, holidays)
- Security incident response (device isolation)
- Hardware maintenance requiring full power-off
- Decommissioning devices before storage/shipment
- Emergency response to prevent data exfiltration
- Scheduled shutdowns for lab/classroom devices
- Extended maintenance periods
- Device preparation for physical relocation

### User Impact - CRITICAL

- Users lose ALL unsaved work
- Device becomes COMPLETELY unavailable
- Physical access required to restart
- Significant productivity loss possible
- Users cannot access device remotely
- Active sessions terminated immediately
- No automatic recovery
- Device remains offline indefinitely

### Best Practices

- ONLY use when devices must remain offline
- Ensure physical access available for restart
- Notify users well in advance
- Schedule for end of day or weekends
- Document reason in change management
- Verify device location (ensure accessible)
- **Consider reboot instead whenever possible**
- Test with small groups first

## Schema

### Required

- `device_ids` (List of String) List of managed device IDs to shut down. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Multiple devices can be shut down in a single action. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

**Critical Warning:** Devices will power off completely when they receive this command. Physical access will be required to power devices back on. Any unsaved work will be lost. Use this action only when devices need to remain powered off.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
