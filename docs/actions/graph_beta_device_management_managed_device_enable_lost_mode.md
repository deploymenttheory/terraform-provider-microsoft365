### What is Lost Mode?

Lost mode is an Apple security feature that:
- Locks device and displays custom message with contact info
- Enables device location tracking
- Prevents unauthorized access to device data
- Helps recover lost or stolen devices
- Can be enabled via Intune or Find My app

### When to Enable Lost Mode

- Device has been reported lost or stolen
- Need to remotely lock and secure device
- Need to display recovery contact information
- Need to track device location for recovery
- Prevent unauthorized access to corporate data
- User cannot be reached to secure device manually

### What Happens When Enabled

- Device is immediately locked
- Custom message displayed on lock screen with contact info
- Location tracking is enabled
- Device cannot be unlocked without proper credentials
- Device data remains encrypted and protected
- User must contact provided phone number to recover device

### Message Best Practices

- Include clear instructions for returning the device
- Provide a contact phone number that will be monitored
- Keep message concise and professional
- Include organization name or identification
- Avoid including sensitive information
- Consider including reward information if applicable

## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_devices` (Block List) List of co-managed devices to enable lost mode for. These are iOS/iPadOS devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM). Each entry specifies a device ID and the custom lost mode configuration.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--comanaged_devices))
- `managed_devices` (Block List) List of managed devices to enable lost mode for. These are iOS/iPadOS devices fully managed by Intune only. Each entry specifies a device ID and the custom lost mode configuration for that device.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. You can provide both to enable lost mode on different types of devices in one action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--managed_devices))
