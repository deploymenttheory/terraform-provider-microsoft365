## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_devices` (Attributes List) List of co-managed Windows devices to update with individual device account configurations. These are devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM). Configuration is identical to managed_devices.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--comanaged_devices))
- `managed_devices` (Attributes List) List of managed Windows devices to update with individual device account configurations. Each entry specifies a device ID and its complete device account settings including credentials, Exchange server, and synchronization options. These are devices fully managed by Intune only.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--managed_devices))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--comanaged_devices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `comanaged_devices`

Required:

- `calendar_sync_enabled` (Boolean) Whether calendar synchronization is enabled. See managed_devices.calendar_sync_enabled for details.
- `device_account_email` (String) The email address of the device account. See managed_devices.device_account_email for details.
- `device_id` (String) The co-managed device ID (GUID). Example: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
- `password` (String) The password for the device account. See managed_devices.password for details.
- `password_rotation_enabled` (Boolean) Whether automatic password rotation is enabled. See managed_devices.password_rotation_enabled for details.

Optional:

- `exchange_server` (String) The Exchange server address. See managed_devices.exchange_server for details.
- `session_initiation_protocol_address` (String) The SIP address for Teams/SfB. See managed_devices.session_initiation_protocol_address for details.


<a id="nestedatt--managed_devices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `managed_devices`

Required:

- `calendar_sync_enabled` (Boolean) Whether calendar synchronization is enabled for the device. This determines if the device will sync its calendar from Exchange.

- **`true`**: Enable calendar sync (shows meetings, availability)
- **`false`**: Disable calendar sync (no meeting information displayed)

**Use Cases:**
- Teams Rooms: Typically enabled (display meeting schedule)
- Surface Hub: Typically enabled (meeting coordination)
- Kiosk devices: May be disabled (no calendar needed)
- `device_account_email` (String) The email address of the device account (resource mailbox). This is typically a room mailbox in Exchange for Teams Rooms or Surface Hub. Example: `conference-room-01@company.com` or `surfacehub-lobby@company.com`

**Requirements:**
- Must be a valid email address
- Must exist in Exchange/Microsoft 365
- Should be a room or equipment mailbox
- Requires appropriate licenses
- `device_id` (String) The managed device ID (GUID) of the Windows device to update. Example: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
- `password` (String) The password for the device account. This password is used to authenticate the device with Exchange and Teams/Skype for Business services. The password is transmitted securely and stored encrypted.

**Best Practices:**
- Use a strong, complex password
- Consider enabling password rotation
- Store securely (use Terraform sensitive values)
- Rotate regularly for security
- Follow organizational password policies
- `password_rotation_enabled` (Boolean) Whether automatic password rotation is enabled for the device account. When enabled, the device will automatically rotate its password periodically.

- **`true`**: Enable automatic password rotation (recommended for security)
- **`false`**: Disable automatic password rotation (manual management required)

**Note:** When enabled, ensure the device account has appropriate permissions in Active Directory to change its own password.

Optional:

- `exchange_server` (String) The Exchange server address for mailbox connectivity. This can be an on-premises Exchange server or Exchange Online (Microsoft 365).

**Examples:**
- Exchange Online: `outlook.office365.com`
- On-premises: `mail.company.com` or `exchange.company.local`
- Autodiscover: Leave blank to use autodiscover

**Note:** If not specified, the device will attempt to use Exchange autodiscover to locate the appropriate Exchange server automatically.
- `session_initiation_protocol_address` (String) The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) address for Teams/Skype for Business connectivity. This is the SIP URI for the device account, typically matching the email address but with 'sip:' prefix.

**Format:** `sip:username@domain.com`

**Examples:**
- `sip:conference-room-01@company.com`
- `sip:surfacehub-lobby@company.com`

**Requirements:**
- Required for Teams/Skype for Business functionality
- Must match the device account UPN or email
- Account must be enabled for Teams/SfB
- Requires appropriate licensing


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
