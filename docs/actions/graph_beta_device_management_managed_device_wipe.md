# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_wipe (Action)

Wipes managed devices from Microsoft Intune using the `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/wipe` endpoint. This action performs a factory reset, removing all data (company and personal) from the device. The device is returned to its out-of-box state and removed from Intune management. This action supports wiping multiple devices in a single operation.

**Important Notes:**
- This action removes **ALL** data from the device unless `keep_user_data` is set to `true`
- For iOS/iPadOS devices, Activation Lock must be disabled or unlock code provided
- For Windows devices, you can use protected wipe to maintain UEFI-embedded licenses
- For Android devices, factory reset protection must be disabled
- This action cannot be reversed - all data will be permanently deleted

### Wipe vs Retire

| Action | Data Removed | Use Case |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Wipe** | All data (factory reset) | Company devices, security incidents, recycling |
| **Retire** | Company data only | BYOD devices, selective removal |

### Wipe Options

#### `keep_enrollment_data`
- Preserves enrollment data during wipe
- Allows device to automatically re-enroll
- Useful for device refresh scenarios
- Supported: Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Android

#### `keep_user_data`
- Performs selective wipe
- Only company data removed
- Personal data preserved
- Similar to retire action
- Supported: iOS, iPadOS, Windows

#### `macos_unlock_code`
- 6-digit PIN for macOS Activation Lock bypass
- Required for macOS with Activation Lock
- Retrieved from Intune portal
- Must be provided before wipe
- macOS only

#### `obliteration_behavior`
- Controls fallback when Erase All Content and Settings (EACS) fails
- Options: `default`, `doNotObliterate`, `obliterateWithWarning`, `always`
- macOS 12+ with Apple M1/T2 chip only
- Affects data erasure completeness

#### `persist_esim_data_plan`
- Preserves eSIM cellular data plan
- Prevents need to reconfigure cellular
- iOS/iPadOS with eSIM support

#### `use_protected_wipe`
- Attempts to preserve UEFI licenses
- Windows-specific option
- May help with Windows reactivation

### What Gets Removed

- **All user data** (unless `keep_user_data` specified)
- **All apps** (system and installed)
- **All settings and configurations**
- **Management enrollment** (unless `keep_enrollment_data`)
- **Accounts and profiles**
- **Device returns to factory state**

### Common Use Cases

- Device recycling or disposal
- Device repurposing for new user
- Security incident response (compromised device)
- Stolen device data protection
- Device return to vendor
- Complete device reset needed
- Departing employee (company device)
- Device compliance violation

### Security Considerations

- **Irreversible**: Data cannot be recovered
- **Activation Lock**: Handle for iOS/macOS devices
- **BitLocker**: Recovery keys may be needed
- **Backup**: Ensure important data backed up
- **Verification**: Confirm correct device before wiping
- **Documentation**: Log reason for wipe
- **Compliance**: Follow data retention policies

### User Impact - CRITICAL

- **ALL data lost permanently**
- **Cannot be undone**
- **Device unusable until reconfigured**
- **Personal data lost** (unless `keep_user_data`)
- **Photos, documents, apps removed**
- **Accounts must be reconfigured**
- **May take several minutes to complete**

### Best Practices

- **Verify device ID** before wiping
- **Confirm with user** for BYOD
- **Back up critical data** first
- **Document business justification**
- **Use retire for BYOD** instead
- **Test selective wipe** options first
- **Consider Activation Lock** for Apple devices
- **Plan for device reprovisioning**
- **Communicate with users**
- **Follow change management** procedures

### Wipe Process

1. Wipe command issued via this action
2. Command queued in Intune
3. Device receives command (when online)
4. Device begins factory reset
5. All data erased
6. Device returns to setup screen
7. Device can be reconfigured
8. Re-enrollment (if `keep_enrollment_data`)

## Schema

### Required

- `device_ids` (List of String) List of managed device IDs to wipe. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Multiple devices can be wiped in a single action. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

### Optional

- `keep_enrollment_data` (Boolean) If `true`, maintains enrollment state data during wipe. This allows the device to automatically re-enroll after being wiped. Defaults to `false`.
- `keep_user_data` (Boolean) If `true`, preserves user data during the wipe operation. Only company data and managed apps are removed. **Note:** Not supported on all device types. Defaults to `false`.
- `macos_unlock_code` (String) The 6-digit PIN required to unlock macOS devices with Activation Lock enabled. Required for supervised macOS devices with Activation Lock. Format: 6-digit numeric string.
- `obliteration_behavior` (String) Specifies the obliteration behavior for macOS 12+ devices with Apple M1 chip or Apple T2 Security Chip. This controls fallback behavior when Erase All Content and Settings (EACS) cannot run.

Valid values:
- `default`: If EACS preflight fails, device responds with Error status and attempts to erase itself. If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, the device attempts to erase itself.
- `doNotObliterate`: If EACS preflight fails, device responds with Error status and doesn't attempt to erase. If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, the device doesn't attempt to erase itself.
- `obliterateWithWarning`: If EACS preflight fails, device responds with Acknowledged status and attempts to erase itself. If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, the device attempts to erase itself.
- `always`: The system doesn't attempt EACS. T2 and later devices always obliterate.

**Note:** This setting only applies to Mac computers with Apple M1 chip or Apple T2 Security Chip running macOS 12 or later. It has no effect on machines prior to the T2 chip.

**Reference:** [obliterationBehavior enum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-devices-obliterationbehavior?view=graph-rest-beta)
- `persist_esim_data_plan` (Boolean) If `true`, preserves the eSIM data plan on the device during wipe. Only applicable to devices with eSIM support. Defaults to `false`.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `use_protected_wipe` (Boolean) If `true`, uses protected wipe for Windows 10/11 devices. Protected wipe maintains UEFI-embedded product keys and recovery partition. Only applicable to Windows devices. Defaults to `false`.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
