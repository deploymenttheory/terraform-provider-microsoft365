## Use Cases

This action is essential for managing Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) licenses across iOS and iPadOS devices:

### License Management
- **Device Retirement**: Reclaim VPP licenses from devices being retired, decommissioned, or returned to inventory
- **User Departure**: Recover VPP app licenses when employees or students leave the organization
- **License Reallocation**: Free up licenses from inactive or underutilized devices for reassignment to active users
- **Device Platform Change**: Reclaim licenses when replacing iOS/iPadOS devices with other platforms
- **License Optimization**: Identify and revoke licenses from devices that no longer need specific VPP apps
- **Compliance Requirements**: Ensure license compliance by revoking licenses from non-compliant or unsupported devices
- **Emergency Scenarios**: Quickly revoke licenses from lost or stolen devices to prevent unauthorized app usage

### IT Operations
- **Bulk License Recovery**: Perform large-scale license reclamation across multiple devices simultaneously
- **Automated License Cleanup**: Schedule regular license audits to recover licenses from inactive devices
- **Cost Optimization**: Maximize ROI on VPP app purchases by ensuring licenses are actively used
- **Inventory Management**: Maintain accurate license inventory and availability tracking
- **Deployment Preparation**: Clear old licenses before deploying new VPP app assignments

### Educational Institutions
- **Semester End Cleanup**: Revoke licenses from graduating students' devices or devices returned at term end
- **Device Reassignment**: Prepare devices for new students by revoking previous VPP app licenses
- **Shared Device Programs**: Manage VPP licenses on shared iPads between different students or classes

## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

This remote action is only available for iOS and iPadOS devices with VPP-purchased apps. The table below shows platform support:

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|:---------|:----------|:------|
| **Windows** | ❌ | Not supported - VPP is Apple-specific |
| **macOS** | ❌ | Not supported - Uses different licensing model |
| **iOS** | ✅ | Fully supported for VPP apps |
| **iPadOS** | ✅ | Fully supported for VPP apps |
| **Android** | ❌ | Not supported - Uses Google Play licensing |
| **Android Enterprise** | ❌ | Not supported - Uses managed Google Play |
| **ChromeOS** | ❌ | Not supported - Uses Chrome Web Store licensing |

### Important Considerations

**License Impact:**
- **All VPP Licenses Revoked**: This action revokes ALL Apple Volume Purchase Program licenses from the specified devices, not individual apps
- **Immediate Effect**: Licenses are immediately returned to your organization's available VPP license pool
- **App Removal**: VPP apps may be automatically removed from the devices depending on app configuration and policies
- **User Data**: User data for VPP apps is typically preserved on the device unless apps are removed by policy
- **License Availability**: Revoked licenses are immediately available for reassignment to other devices or users in Apple Business Manager
- **Cannot Be Undone**: License revocation cannot be easily undone; licenses must be manually reassigned if needed

**Device Requirements:**
- **Online Status**: Devices should be online to receive and acknowledge license revocation commands
- **VPP Enrollment**: Only affects apps purchased through Apple Volume Purchase Program (now Apple Business Manager)
- **Supervised Devices**: Works for both supervised and unsupervised iOS/iPadOS devices with VPP apps
- **Management Status**: Devices must be actively enrolled and managed by Intune
- **Network Connectivity**: Devices need network access to sync license changes with Apple's servers

**Apple Business Manager:**
- **License Pool**: Revoked licenses return to your organization's VPP license pool visible in Apple Business Manager
- **License Tracking**: License changes are audited and tracked in both Intune and Apple Business Manager portals
- **Sync Delay**: There may be a brief delay before license counts update in Apple Business Manager
- **Assignment Flexibility**: Revoked licenses can be reassigned to any device or user in your organization

**VPP Program:**
- **VPP Apps Only**: Only affects apps purchased through Apple's Volume Purchase Program (VPP) / Apps and Books
- **Non-VPP Apps**: Apps purchased through other means (App Store, custom enterprise apps) are not affected
- **App Store Apps**: Regular App Store apps installed by users are not affected by this action
- **In-House Apps**: Custom in-house enterprise apps distributed outside VPP are not affected

**Operational Considerations:**
- **Bulk Operations**: Consider breaking very large operations (100+ devices) into smaller batches to manage execution time
- **Device Responsiveness**: Devices must check in with Intune to receive and process the license revocation command
- **Error Handling**: Some devices may fail to revoke licenses due to offline status or network issues; check action results carefully
- **Monitoring**: Monitor Apple Business Manager for license count changes to confirm successful revocations
- **Coordination**: Coordinate with Apple Business Manager administrators when performing large-scale license revocations

**Best Practices:**
- **License Audit**: Regularly audit VPP license usage to identify underutilized licenses for potential revocation
- **Device Status Check**: Verify device online status before revoking licenses to ensure timely processing
- **User Communication**: Inform users before revoking VPP licenses to prevent disruption and manage expectations
- **License Tracking**: Maintain records of license revocations for audit and inventory management purposes
- **Staged Approach**: For large-scale revocations, use a phased approach to minimize impact and monitor results
- **Backup Plan**: Have a process to quickly reassign licenses if revocation was performed in error
- **ABM Integration**: Ensure proper integration between Intune and Apple Business Manager for seamless license management

## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_device_ids` (List of String) List of co-managed device IDs to revoke Apple VPP licenses from. These are iOS/iPadOS devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM). Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"]`

**Note:** Co-management is rare for iOS/iPadOS devices but supported by this action. At least one of `managed_device_ids` or `comanaged_device_ids` must be provided.
- `managed_device_ids` (List of String) List of managed device IDs to revoke Apple VPP licenses from. These are iOS/iPadOS devices fully managed by Intune only. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. All VPP licenses will be revoked from these devices. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

**Note:** At least one of `managed_device_ids` or `comanaged_device_ids` must be provided. You can provide both to revoke licenses from different types of devices in one action.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
