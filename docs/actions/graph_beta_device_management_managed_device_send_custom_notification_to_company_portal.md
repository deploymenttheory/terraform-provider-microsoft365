## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

This action works across all platforms where the Company Portal app is available and installed:

| Platform | Supported | Company Portal App Required |
|:---------|:----------|:---------------------------|
| **Windows 10** | ✅ | Company Portal from Microsoft Store |
| **Windows 11** | ✅ | Company Portal from Microsoft Store |
| **macOS** | ✅ | Company Portal from App Store |
| **iOS** | ✅ | Company Portal from App Store |
| **iPadOS** | ✅ | Company Portal from App Store |
| **Android** | ✅ | Company Portal from Google Play |
| **Android Enterprise** | ✅ | Company Portal from managed Google Play |
| **ChromeOS** | ⚠️ | Limited support - requires Company Portal extension |

### Important Considerations

**Company Portal Requirements:**
- **App Installation**: Company Portal app must be installed on the target device
- **User Sign-In**: User must be signed into the Company Portal app to receive notifications
- **App Version**: Company Portal app should be updated to latest version for best compatibility
- **Notification Permissions**: Company Portal must have notification permissions enabled on the device
- **Background App**: Company Portal may need to be running in background on some platforms
- **Device Enrollment**: Device must be actively enrolled and managed by Intune

**Notification Delivery:**
- **Delivery Method**: Notifications are delivered through the Company Portal app, not as OS-level push notifications
- **Timing**: Notifications appear when users open or check the Company Portal app
- **Persistence**: Notifications persist in the Company Portal notifications section until dismissed by user
- **No Guaranteed Delivery**: There is no delivery confirmation; notification may fail silently if requirements not met
- **Network Dependency**: Device requires network connectivity to receive notifications
- **Offline Devices**: Offline devices will receive notifications when they reconnect and sync with Intune

**Per-Device Customization:**
- **Individual Messages**: Each device can have a completely different notification title and body
- **Personalization**: Enables personalized messaging based on device state, user, or other attributes
- **Flexible Targeting**: Mix different message types in single action (e.g., different expiration dates)
- **Dynamic Content**: Use Terraform's dynamic blocks to generate device-specific messages from data sources

**Notification Content Guidelines:**
- **Title Length**: Keep titles concise (50-60 characters recommended, 250 character maximum)
- **Body Length**: Keep body messages clear and actionable (200-300 characters recommended, 1000 character maximum)
- **Clear Language**: Use simple, direct language that users can understand
- **Call to Action**: Include specific next steps or actions for users to take
- **Contact Information**: Provide support contact details when appropriate
- **Urgency Indication**: Clearly indicate if action is urgent or time-sensitive
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain professional, respectful communication tone

**User Experience:**
- **In-App Display**: Notifications appear in the Company Portal app's notification section
- **No OS Notification**: Typically does not trigger operating system push notifications
- **User Dismissal**: Users can dismiss notifications; they won't reappear after dismissal
- **No Response Tracking**: No way to track if users read or acted on notifications
- **Multiple Notifications**: Sending multiple notifications to same device accumulates in notification list

**Operational Considerations:**
- **Bulk Notifications**: This action supports sending different messages to many devices simultaneously
- **Concurrent Processing**: Notifications are sent concurrently for better performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when sending to thousands of devices
- **Retry Logic**: Failed notification sends are not automatically retried; use Terraform retry mechanisms if needed
- **Idempotency**: Re-running the action sends duplicate notifications; avoid frequent re-runs
- **Testing**: Test notifications with small groups before large-scale deployments

**Time Zone Considerations:**
- **No Scheduling**: This action sends notifications immediately; no built-in scheduling capability
- **User Time Zones**: Consider user time zones when sending time-sensitive notifications
- **Business Hours**: Best practice to send during business hours in target user's region
- **After-Hours**: Avoid sending non-urgent notifications during nights or weekends
- **Global Deployments**: For global organizations, stage notifications by region/time zone

**Best Practices:**
- **Targeted Messaging**: Use filters and data sources to target specific device groups
- **Message Clarity**: Ensure messages are clear, actionable, and provide necessary context
- **Frequency Management**: Avoid notification fatigue by limiting frequency of messages
- **User-Centric**: Write from user's perspective; focus on what they need to do
- **Test First**: Always test with small group before organization-wide rollout
- **Fallback Communication**: Have backup communication channels (email, Teams) for critical messages
- **Accessibility**: Use clear language and avoid jargon for accessibility
- **Localization**: Consider language localization for multinational organizations
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of notifications sent for audit and reference

**Technical Limitations:**
- **No Read Receipts**: No way to confirm users have read the notification
- **No Response Collection**: Cannot collect user responses or acknowledgments through this action
- **No Notification History**: Limited ability to retrieve sent notification history through API
- **Character Limits**: Titles (250 chars) and bodies (1000 chars) have strict limits enforced by API
- **No Rich Media**: Cannot include images, links, or rich formatting in notifications
- **No Actionable Buttons**: Cannot add buttons or interactive elements to notifications

**Security Considerations:**
- **Information Disclosure**: Avoid including sensitive information in notification content
- **Authentication**: Notifications visible to anyone with access to Company Portal on device
- **Phishing Prevention**: Use consistent, recognizable language to prevent phishing confusion
- **Contact Verification**: Users should verify unexpected notifications through official channels
- **Audit Logging**: All notification actions are logged in Intune audit logs

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Not Receiving Notifications**: Verify Company Portal is installed, user is signed in, and device is enrolled
- **Delayed Notifications**: Check device network connectivity and Company Portal app sync status
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure Company Portal has necessary notification permissions on device
- **Silent Failures**: API may return success even if notification isn't delivered; verify delivery separately
- **App Not Installed**: If Company Portal isn't installed, notification fails silently without error

**Monitoring & Analytics:**
- **Delivery Confirmation**: No built-in delivery confirmation or read receipts available
- **Audit Logs**: Check Intune audit logs to see notification send attempts and any errors
- **User Feedback**: Rely on user feedback or support tickets to gauge notification effectiveness
- **Action Logs**: Check Terraform/provider logs for any errors during notification sending
