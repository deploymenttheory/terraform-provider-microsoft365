The sound plays for a specified duration to assist in physically locating the device. This action supports playing sounds on multiple devices in a single operation with per-device duration settings.

**Important Notes:**
- Only applicable to iOS and iPadOS devices in lost mode
- Device must be supervised
- Device must currently be in lost mode
- Sound plays even if device is in silent mode
- Requires device to be online to receive command
- Each device can have its own sound duration

**Use Cases:**
- Device is nearby but cannot be visually located
- Device is in lost mode and needs audible alert
- Assisting user in finding device in office or home
- Confirming device location before recovery

**Platform Support:**
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Fully supported (supervised devices in lost mode only)
- **Other Platforms**: Not applicable - lost mode is iOS/iPadOS only

### What is Play Lost Mode Sound?

Play Lost Mode Sound is a feature that:
- Plays an audible alert on iOS/iPadOS devices
- Works only when device is in lost mode
- Sound plays even if device is in silent mode
- Helps physically locate devices that are nearby
- Sound duration can be customized per device
- Useful for finding devices in known general locations

### When to Play Lost Mode Sound

- Device is believed to be nearby but cannot be visually located
- Confirming device location before physical recovery
- Assisting user in finding device in office, home, or vehicle
- Device is in lost mode and approximate location is known
- Need audible confirmation of device presence in area
- Supplementing GPS location tracking with audio cues

### What Happens When Sound is Played

- Device immediately begins playing an audible alert
- Sound plays regardless of device silent mode setting
- Alert continues for the specified duration
- Helps pinpoint exact physical location of device
- Lost mode status remains unchanged
- Action can be repeated as needed
- No visual indication on device screen beyond lost mode message

## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_devices` (Block List) List of co-managed devices to play lost mode sound on. These are iOS/iPadOS devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM). Each entry specifies a device ID and the duration to play the sound.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--comanaged_devices))
- `managed_devices` (Block List) List of managed devices to play lost mode sound on. These are iOS/iPadOS devices fully managed by Intune only. Each entry specifies a device ID and the duration to play the sound.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. You can provide both to play sounds on different types of devices in one action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--managed_devices))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
