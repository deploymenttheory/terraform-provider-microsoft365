# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_recover_passcode (Action)

Recovers passcodes for managed devices using the `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/recoverPasscode` endpoint. This action retrieves existing passcodes that are escrowed in Intune, which is different from reset passcode that generates new temporary passcodes. Recover passcode is primarily used for iOS/iPadOS devices where passcodes may be escrowed during enrollment or management.

**Important Notes:**
- Retrieves existing escrowed passcode from Intune
- Different from reset passcode (which creates new passcode)
- Passcode must have been previously escrowed
- Primarily for iOS/iPadOS supervised devices
- Retrieved passcode displayed in Intune portal
- May not be available for all device types

**Use Cases:**
- User forgot their device passcode (iOS/iPadOS)
- Supervised device lockout recovery
- Administrative access to escrowed passcodes
- Device recovery without factory reset
- Emergency access to locked devices
- Help desk support for locked devices

**Platform Support:**
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Supported (supervised devices with passcode escrow)
- **macOS**: Limited (may work with specific configurations)
- **Windows**: Not typically supported for passcode recovery
- **Android**: Not typically supported for passcode recovery

**Passcode Escrow:**
- Passcodes must be escrowed during device enrollment
- Not all devices escrow passcodes automatically
- Supervised iOS/iPadOS devices typically escrow passcodes
- Check device enrollment configuration for escrow settings
- Recovery may fail if passcode not escrowed

**Recover vs Reset Passcode:**
- **Recover**: Retrieves existing escrowed passcode (no change to device)
- **Reset**: Generates new temporary passcode (device must be unlocked and reset)
- Use recover first if passcode is escrowed
- Use reset if recover fails or passcode not escrowed

## Version History

| Version | Status | Notes |

## Notes

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Support | Escrow Requirements |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **iOS** | ✅ Full Support | Supervised, DEP/ABM enrolled, escrow enabled |
| **iPadOS** | ✅ Full Support | Supervised, DEP/ABM enrolled, escrow enabled |
| **macOS** | ⚠️ Limited | Specific configurations, rarely used |
| **Windows** | ❌ Not Supported | Windows passcode recovery not available |
| **Android** | ❌ Not Supported | Android passcode recovery not available |

### Recover vs Reset Passcode

| Action | What It Does | Best For | Requirements |
|--------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Recover** | Retrieves existing escrowed passcode | Supervised iOS/iPadOS with escrow | Passcode must be escrowed |
| **Reset** | Generates new temporary passcode | Any supported device | Device must be online |

### What is Passcode Escrow?

Passcode escrow is a security feature that:
- Stores encrypted copy of device passcode in Intune
- Configured during device enrollment setup
- Primarily available for supervised iOS/iPadOS devices
- Requires specific enrollment profile settings
- Enables IT to recover (not reset) user passcodes
- Useful for emergency device access

### Escrow Configuration Requirements

For passcode recovery to work, devices must:
1. Be supervised (iOS/iPadOS)
2. Enrolled via DEP/ABM or Apple Configurator
3. Have passcode escrow enabled in enrollment profile
4. Have user-set passcode after escrow enabled
5. Passcode must be actively escrowed (not expired)

### When to Use Recover vs Reset

**Use Recover Passcode When:**
- Device is supervised iOS/iPadOS
- Passcode escrow is confirmed enabled
- You want the user's original passcode
- No device configuration change desired
- User forgot passcode but device enrolled correctly

**Use Reset Passcode When:**
- Passcode recovery fails (not escrowed)
- Device is unsupervised
- Platform doesn't support escrow (Windows, Android)
- You need to force a passcode change
- Passcode escrow wasn't configured

### How to Verify Passcode Escrow

Before attempting recovery:
1. Check device enrollment profile settings
2. Verify "Escrow passcode" is enabled
3. Confirm device is supervised
4. Check device was enrolled with correct profile
5. Verify enrollment wasn't bypassed

### Retrieving Recovered Passcode

After successful recovery:
1. Navigate to Microsoft Intune admin center
2. Select Devices > All devices
3. Choose the device
4. View device properties or hardware information
5. Look for "Passcode" or "Recovery" section
6. Passcode displayed as plain text or retrievable
7. Securely communicate to authorized user

### Common Failure Reasons

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Not escrowed | Passcode never saved to Intune | Use reset passcode instead |
| Unsupervised | Device not in supervised mode | Re-enroll via DEP/ABM |
| Wrong profile | Enrolled without escrow enabled | Check enrollment profile settings |
| Expired escrow | Passcode changed after enrollment | May need to reset instead |
| Wrong platform | Windows/Android attempted | Use reset for these platforms |

### Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Recovered passcodes are actual user passcodes
- **Access Control**: Strictly limit who can recover passcodes
- **Verification**: Verify user identity before providing passcode
- **Communication**: Never send passcodes via email or unsecured chat
- **Documentation**: Log all passcode recovery requests
- **Compliance**: Ensure recovery aligns with privacy policies
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain records of who recovered what/when

### Best Practices

- Try recover before reset (preserves user experience)
- Verify escrow status before attempting recovery
- Have reset passcode as fallback option
- Implement approval workflow for recovery requests
- Train help desk on when to use recover vs reset
- Document business justification for recovery
- Secure passcode communication channels
- Monitor for patterns of repeated recovery
- Review enrollment profiles regularly
- Test escrow functionality with test devices

## Schema

### Required

- `device_ids` (List of String) List of managed device IDs to recover passcodes for. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Multiple devices can have passcodes recovered in a single action. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

**Important:** This action retrieves existing escrowed passcodes. If a passcode was not escrowed during device enrollment, the recovery will fail. Check device properties in Intune to verify passcode escrow status before attempting recovery.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
