### How Remote Lock Works

- Command sent to device immediately if online
- Device locks screen instantly upon receiving command
- User must enter existing passcode to unlock
- Lock is enforced by operating system
- Command queued if device offline
- Device locks when it next checks in
- No data is erased, device remains functional once unlocked

### Common Use Cases

- Lost device scenarios
- Stolen device immediate response
- Security incident response
- Unauthorized device access prevention
- Compliance enforcement
- Compromised credential response
- Emergency device isolation
- User-requested device locking

### User Impact

- Screen locks immediately
- Existing passcode required to unlock
- No data loss
- Notifications may still appear on lock screen
- Device remains connected to network
- Background processes continue
- No warning provided to user

### Best Practices

- Document reason for lock in incident log
- Combine with locate device for lost devices
- Follow up with user communication
- Consider lost mode for iOS/iPadOS devices
- Use as first step in security incident response
- Monitor device status after lock command
- Have unlock procedure documented
- Consider follow-up actions (wipe, retire) if needed

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1: Remote lock a single device (lost device scenario)
action "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_remote_lock" "lock_lost_device" {

# Example 8: Lock devices by device name pattern (department-specific)
data "microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device" "department_devices" {
  filter_type  = "device_name"
  filter_value = "SALES-"
}

  value       = length(action.lock_compromised_user.device_ids)
  description = "Number of devices locked in emergency scenario"
}

# Important Note: 
# - Devices lock IMMEDIATELY when they receive the command
# - Users must enter their existing passcode to unlock
# - For lost devices, follow up with locate/wipe if needed
# - Document the reason for locking devices for compliance/audit purposes

## Schema

### Required

- `device_ids` (List of String) List of managed device IDs to remotely lock. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Multiple devices can be locked in a single action. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

**Important:** Devices will lock immediately when they receive the command. Ensure you have authorization to lock these devices. For lost or stolen devices, this provides an immediate security measure while you determine next steps (locate, wipe, etc.).

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
