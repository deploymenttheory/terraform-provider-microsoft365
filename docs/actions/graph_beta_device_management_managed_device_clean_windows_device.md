# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_clean_windows_device (Action)

Performs a clean operation on Windows managed devices using the `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/cleanWindowsDevice` endpoint. This action provides a lighter-weight alternative to full device wipe, allowing IT administrators to remove applications and settings while optionally preserving user data.

**What Clean Windows Device Does:**
- Removes installed applications (except inbox Windows apps)
- Removes user profiles (unless `keep_user_data` is true)
- Removes device configuration settings
- Removes company policies and profiles
- Can preserve user data if specified
- Device remains enrolled in Intune
- Less destructive than full wipe

**Platform Support:**
- **Windows**: Full support (Windows 10/11)
- **Other platforms**: Not supported (Windows-only action)

**Clean vs Wipe vs Retire:**
- **Clean**: Removes apps/settings, optionally keeps user data, device stays enrolled
- **Wipe**: Factory reset, removes all data, device must re-enroll
- **Retire**: Removes company data only, preserves personal data

**Common Use Cases:**
- Device refresh without full rebuild
- Removing malware/unwanted applications
- Preparing device for new user (keeping OS)
- Troubleshooting device issues
- Compliance remediation
- Software bloat removal
- Maintaining device enrollment

**Important Considerations:**
- Device must be online to receive command
- User will lose unsaved work
- Installed applications will be removed
- Process may take several minutes
- Device remains in Intune (no re-enrollment needed)
- `keep_user_data` preserves user profiles and data

### Clean vs Wipe vs Retire

| Action | What's Removed | User Data | Enrollment | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Clean** | Apps, settings | Optional | Preserved | Device refresh, app removal |
| **Wipe** | Everything | Removed | Lost (must re-enroll) | Full reset, security incidents |
| **Retire** | Company data only | Personal kept | Removed | BYOD unenrollment |

### What Gets Removed

#### When `keep_user_data = false` (Full Clean)
- Installed applications (except inbox Windows apps)
- User profiles
- User data (documents, desktop, downloads, etc.)
- Device configuration settings
- Company policies and profiles
- Personal customizations

#### When `keep_user_data = true` (App Clean)
- Installed applications (except inbox Windows apps)
- Device configuration settings
- Company policies and profiles

### What is Preserved

Regardless of `keep_user_data` setting:
- Windows OS installation
- Intune enrollment
- Device object in Intune
- Inbox Windows applications
- Device hardware configuration
- BitLocker encryption (if configured)

When `keep_user_data = true`:
- User profiles
- User documents and files
- Desktop, downloads, pictures, etc.
- User registry settings

### Common Use Cases

#### Full Clean (`keep_user_data = false`)
- Device reassignment to new user
- Malware removal requiring complete cleanup
- Compliance remediation
- Device refresh before new deployment
- Preparing device for return or disposal
- Removing previous user's data and settings

#### Preserve Data Clean (`keep_user_data = true`)
- Application troubleshooting
- Software bloat removal
- Performance optimization
- Configuration reset
- Maintaining user environment
- Fixing application conflicts
- Removing unwanted installed software

### Operation Details

#### Process Duration
- Typically 10-20 minutes
- Varies based on number of installed applications
- Device remains online during process
- Progress visible in Intune admin center

#### Network Requirements
- Device must be online
- Internet connectivity required
- Cannot be performed offline

#### User Experience
- Device becomes unavailable during clean
- User is automatically logged out
- Unsaved work is lost
- Device may restart
- Login prompt appears after completion

### Best Practices

- **Test First**: Always test with small device groups
- **Schedule Wisely**: Run during maintenance windows or off-hours
- **User Communication**: Notify users in advance of clean operations
- **Data Backup**: Ensure important data is backed up before cleaning
- **Choose Correctly**: Use `keep_user_data = true` for user devices when possible
- **Monitor Progress**: Check device status in Intune after cleaning
- **Sufficient Timeout**: Allow 15-20 minutes timeout for larger operations
- **Document Actions**: Log reason for clean in change management system

### Security Considerations

- **Full Clean**: Use for security incidents or device reassignment
- **Data Sanitization**: Full clean removes user data from device
- **Enrollment Persists**: Device remains in management (not like wipe)
- **BitLocker**: Encryption settings are maintained
- **Compliance**: Device will recheck compliance after clean
- **Policies Reapply**: All policies automatically reapply after clean

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Clean fails | Device offline | Ensure device is connected and online |
| Timeout | Large number of apps | Increase timeout value |
| User data remains | Wrong parameter | Verify `keep_user_data = false` |
| Apps remain | System apps | Inbox Windows apps cannot be removed |
| Device offline | Clean in progress | Wait for process to complete |

## Schema

### Required

- `device_ids` (List of String) List of Windows managed device IDs to clean. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Multiple devices can be cleaned in a single action. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

**Important:** Only Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices are supported. The action will fail for non-Windows devices.
- `keep_user_data` (Boolean) Determines whether user data should be preserved during the clean operation. **Required field** - must be explicitly set to `true` or `false`.

**When `false`:**
- User profiles removed
- User data deleted
- Applications removed
- Settings reset
- Device returned to near-clean state

**When `true`:**
- User profiles preserved
- User data kept (documents, desktop, etc.)
- Applications still removed
- Settings still reset
- User can log back in with existing profile

**Use Cases:**
- `false`: Device reassignment, malware removal, full cleanup
- `true`: Application cleanup, troubleshooting, keeping user environment

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
