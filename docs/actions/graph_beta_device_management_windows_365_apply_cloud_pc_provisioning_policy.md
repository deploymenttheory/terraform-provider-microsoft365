  Applies configuration settings to a Cloud PC provisioning policy using the /deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/provisioningPolicies/{id}/apply endpoint. This action allows applying region or single sign-on settings to existing Cloud PCs that were provisioned with this policy. When you change the network, image, region, or single sign-on configuration in a provisioning policy, the changes only apply to newly provisioned or reprovisioned Cloud PCs. Use this action to apply region or single sign-on changes to previously provisioned Cloud PCs.

## Schema

### Required

- `provisioning_policy_id` (String) The unique identifier of the Cloud PC provisioning policy to apply settings to. This is the ID of the provisioning policy in Microsoft Intune.

### Optional

- `policy_settings` (String) The target property of the apply action. Valid values are:
- `region`: Apply region configuration changes to existing Cloud PCs (default)
- `singleSignOn`: Apply single sign-on configuration changes to existing Cloud PCs

The default value is `region`. This action applies region as a value if this parameter is null.
Note: Network and image changes cannot be applied retrospectively and require reprovisioning.
- `reserve_percentage` (Number) For Frontline shared Cloud PCs only. The percentage of Cloud PCs to keep available. Administrators can set this property to a value from 0 to 99. Cloud PCs are reprovisioned only when there are no active and connected Cloud PC users. This parameter is only applicable for Frontline shared provisioning policies.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
