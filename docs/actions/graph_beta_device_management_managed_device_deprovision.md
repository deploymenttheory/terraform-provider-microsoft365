  Deprovisions Windows managed devices from Intune management using the /deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/deprovision and /deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/deprovision endpoints. This action removes management capabilities from a device while allowing it to remain enrolled. Deprovisioning is less destructive than wiping or retiring a device, as it only removes management policies and profiles without deleting user data or removing the device entirely.

# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_deprovision (Action)

Deprovisions Windows managed devices from Intune management using the `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/deprovision` and `/deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/deprovision` endpoints. This action removes management capabilities from a device while allowing it to remain enrolled. Deprovisioning is less destructive than wiping or retiring a device, as it only removes management policies and profiles without deleting user data or removing the device entirely. This is useful when transitioning devices between management solutions or preparing devices for different management scenarios.

**Important Notes:**
- Device remains enrolled in Intune after deprovisioning
- Management policies and profiles are removed
- User data is preserved on the device
- Less disruptive than wipe or retire actions
- Requires a reason to be specified for auditing
- Primarily used for Windows devices

**Use Cases:**
- Transitioning devices to different management authority
- Preparing devices for repurposing
- Removing management overhead without data loss
- Troubleshooting management issues
- Moving from co-management to different configuration

**Platform Support:**
- **Windows**: Primary platform for deprovisioning
- **Other Platforms**: Limited or no support

### What is Device Deprovisioning?

Device Deprovisioning is an action that:
- Removes management policies and profiles from devices
- Maintains the device's enrollment status in Intune
- Preserves all user data on the device
- Provides a less destructive alternative to wipe or retire
- Requires a reason to be specified for auditing purposes
- Allows devices to be re-managed after deprovisioning

### Deprovision vs Retire vs Wipe

| Action | Management Removed | Enrollment Removed | User Data Preserved | Use Case |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Deprovision** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Management transition, troubleshooting |
| **Retire** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Permanent device removal from management |
| **Wipe** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Factory reset, security incident response |

### When to Deprovision Devices

- Transitioning devices between management solutions
- Moving from Intune-only to co-management scenarios
- Troubleshooting persistent management or policy issues
- Preparing devices for repurposing or reassignment
- Removing management overhead without losing data
- Testing enrollment and management scenarios
- Changing management authority for devices

### What Happens When Device is Deprovisioned

- Intune sends deprovision command to the device
- Device removes management policies and profiles
- Configuration settings applied by Intune are removed
- Device enrollment status remains in Intune
- User data, files, and applications are preserved
- Device can be re-enrolled and managed again
- Deprovision reason is logged for auditing

## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_devices` (Block List) List of co-managed devices to deprovision. These are Windows devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM).

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--comanaged_devices))
- `managed_devices` (Block List) List of managed devices to deprovision. These are Windows devices fully managed by Intune only.

**Note:** At least one of `managed_devices` or `comanaged_devices` must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--managed_devices))

Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
