description: |-
  Disables lost mode on iOS/iPadOS managed devices using the /deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/disableLostMode and /deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/disableLostMode endpoints. This action removes the device from lost mode, allowing normal device operation to resume. Lost mode is a feature that helps locate and secure lost iOS/iPadOS devices by locking them and displaying a custom message with contact information on the lock screen. This action supports disabling lost mode on multiple devices in a single operation.
  Important Notes:
  Only applicable to iOS and iPadOS devices (iOS 9.3+)Device must currently be in lost modeDevice must be supervisedRequires device to be online to receive commandOnce disabled, device returns to normal operationThe custom lock screen message is removed
  Use Cases:

# microsoft365_graph_beta_device_management_managed_device_disable_lost_mode (Action)

Disables lost mode on iOS/iPadOS managed devices using the `/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/disableLostMode` and `/deviceManagement/comanagedDevices/{managedDeviceId}/disableLostMode` endpoints. This action removes the device from lost mode, allowing normal device operation to resume. Lost mode is a feature that helps locate and secure lost iOS/iPadOS devices by locking them and displaying a custom message with contact information on the lock screen. This action supports disabling lost mode on multiple devices in a single operation.

**Important Notes:**
- Only applicable to iOS and iPadOS devices (iOS 9.3+)
- Device must currently be in lost mode
- Device must be supervised
- Requires device to be online to receive command
- Once disabled, device returns to normal operation
- The custom lock screen message is removed

**Use Cases:**
- Device has been recovered and needs to be returned to service
- Lost mode was enabled in error
- Device location has been confirmed and no longer needs tracking
- User has regained possession of their device

**Platform Support:**
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Fully supported (iOS 9.3+, supervised devices only)
- **Other Platforms**: Not applicable - lost mode is iOS/iPadOS only

### What is Lost Mode?

Lost mode is an Apple security feature that:
- Locks device and displays custom message with contact info
- Enables device location tracking
- Prevents unauthorized access to device data
- Helps recover lost or stolen devices
- Automatically enabled via Intune or Find My app

### When to Disable Lost Mode

- Device has been physically recovered
- Device location confirmed and device is safe
- User has regained possession of their device
- Lost mode was enabled in error
- Device is being returned to service
- Device recovery operation completed

### What Happens When Disabled

- Device returns to normal operation
- Custom lock screen message removed
- Device can be unlocked with regular passcode
- Location tracking associated with lost mode stops
- Device becomes fully functional again
- User can access all device features

## Example Usage

# Important Notes:
# Lost Mode Features:
# - Only available for iOS and iPadOS devices (iOS 9.3+)
# - Devices must be supervised to use lost mode
# - Lost mode locks device and displays custom message with contact info
# - Lost mode enables device location tracking
# - Disabling lost mode returns device to normal operation
#
# When to Disable Lost Mode:
# - Device has been physically recovered
# - Device location has been confirmed and it's safe
# - User has regained possession of their device
# - Lost mode was enabled in error
# - Device is being returned to service
#
# What Happens When Lost Mode is Disabled:

# - macOS: Not supported (lost mode is iOS/iPadOS only)
# - Windows: Not supported
# - Android: Not supported
#
# Best Practices:
# - Verify device has been physically recovered before disabling
# - Document recovery details for audit/compliance
# - Confirm user identity before returning device
# - Check device hasn't been compromised during loss
# - Consider security policy before re-enabling full access
# - Update device compliance status if needed
#
# Security Considerations:
# - Ensure device recovery is legitimate
# - Check for signs of tampering
# - Verify no unauthorized access occurred
# - Consider resetting passcode as additional security measure
# - Review device logs for suspicious activity
# - Confirm device certificate/profile integrity
#
# Related Actions:
# - Enable Lost Mode: Use Intune portal (not yet available as provider action)
# - Remote Lock: Lock device immediately without lost mode
# - Locate Device: Use Intune portal to track device location
# - Wipe Device: Factory reset if device cannot be recovered
# - Reset Passcode: Change device passcode remotely

## Schema

### Optional

- `comanaged_device_ids` (List of String) List of co-managed device IDs to disable lost mode for. These are iOS/iPadOS devices managed by both Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM). Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"]`

**Note:** At least one of `managed_device_ids` or `comanaged_device_ids` must be provided.
- `managed_device_ids` (List of String) List of managed device IDs to disable lost mode for. These are iOS/iPadOS devices fully managed by Intune only. Each ID must be a valid GUID format. Example: `["12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc", "87654321-4321-4321-4321-ba9876543210"]`

**Note:** At least one of `managed_device_ids` or `comanaged_device_ids` must be provided. You can provide both to disable lost mode on different types of devices in one action.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
